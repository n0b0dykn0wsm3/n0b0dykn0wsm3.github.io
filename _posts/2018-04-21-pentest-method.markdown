# Penetration Testing Methodology

## PTES
The Penetration Testing Execution Standard ([PTES](http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/PTES_Technical_Guidelines))  can be applied to all types of penetration tests. It outlines the  phases of a penetration test and how they should be conducted. These are  the sections in the PTES:
1. Pre-engagement Interactions
2. Intelligence Gathering
3. Threat Modeling
4. Vulnerability Analysis
5. Exploitation
6. Post Exploitation
7. Reporting

## OSSTMM
[OSSTMM](https://www.isecom.org/OSSTMM.3.pdf) is the Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual, another set of guidelines pentesters can use to ensure they're doing  their jobs properly. It can be used alongside other pentest standards.
OSSTMM is divided into five different channels for five different areas of pentesting:
1. Human Security (human beings are subject to social engineering exploits)
2. Physical Security
3. Wireless Communications (including but not limited to technologies like WiFi and Bluetooth)
4. Telecommunications
5. Data Networks

## NIST
The [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework) (National Institute of Standards and Technology) is well known for their NIST Cybersecurity Framework,  a system for designing incident response policies and procedures. NIST  also has a Penetration Testing Framework. The phases of the NIST  framework include:
1. Planning
1. Discovery
1. Attack
1. Reporting

## OWASP 
[OWASP](https://owasp.org) stands for the Open Web Application Security Project. They're typically the go-to organization for defining testing standards and classifying risks to web applications.
OWASP maintains a few different standards and helpful guides for assessment various technologies:
1. [Web Security Testing Guide](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/) (WSTG)
  - [Information Gathering](-)
  - [Configuration and Deployment Management Testing](-)
  - [Identity Management Testing](-)
  - [Authentication Testing](-)
  - [Authorizaiton Testing](-)
  - [Session Managment Testing](-)
  - [Input Valdation Testing](-)
  - [Testing for Error handling](-)
